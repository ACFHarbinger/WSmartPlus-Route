# Must-Go Strategy: Last Minute (High Threshold)
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE:
#   Aggressive threshold-based strategy - only collect nearly-full bins.
#   Minimizes collection frequency but increases overflow risk.
#
# ALGORITHM:
#   1. Check current fill level for each bin
#   2. Mark bin as must-go if fill >= 0.9
#   3. Very reactive - waits until bins are 90% full
#
# USE CASES:
#   - Cost-sensitive scenarios (minimize total km driven)
#   - Areas with reliable fill patterns (low variance)
#   - Benchmarking aggressive vs conservative thresholds
#
# PARAMETERS:
#   - threshold: 0.9 (90% capacity threshold)
#     Higher than cf70 - trades overflow risk for fewer collections
