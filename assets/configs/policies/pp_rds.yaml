# Post-Processing: Random Local Search (Multi-Operator)
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE:
#   Stochastic local search using weighted random operator selection.
#   Explores neighborhood more broadly than deterministic 2-opt.
#
# ALGORITHM:
#   1. For each iteration:
#      a. Select operator randomly based on probability weights:
#         - two_opt: 20% (intra-route edge reversal)
#         - two_opt_star: 20% (inter-route edge exchange)
#         - swap: 15% (exchange two nodes between routes)
#         - swap_star: 15% (multi-node swap variant)
#         - relocate: 15% (move node to different route)
#         - three_opt: 10% (3-edge reconnection)
#      b. Apply operator, accept if improvement found
#   2. Repeat for iterations cycles
#
# USE CASES:
#   - Escape 2-opt local optima via operator diversity
#   - Benchmarking stochastic vs deterministic search
#   - Multi-route refinement (inter-route operators)
#
# PERFORMANCE:
#   - More exploratory than classical 2-opt
#   - Improvement: 5-12% over greedy construction
#   - Non-deterministic (results vary across runs)
#
# PARAMETERS:
#   - Operator probabilities (must sum to ≤1.0):
#     - two_opt: 0.2 (intra-route, fast)
#     - two_opt_star: 0.2 (inter-route edge swap)
#     - swap: 0.15 (node exchange between routes)
#     - swap_star: 0.15 (enhanced swap)
#     - relocate: 0.15 (node relocation)
#     - three_opt: 0.1 (complex 3-edge moves)
#   - iterations: 1000 (total operator applications)
