# Must-Go Strategy: Lookahead (Predictive Overflow Detection)
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE:
#   Collect bins predicted to overflow within the next collection cycle.
#   Uses GRF (Gated Recurrent Fill) predictor to forecast future fill levels.
#
# ALGORITHM:
#   1. Predict fill level for each bin at current_collection_day + lookahead_days
#   2. Mark bins as must-go if predicted_fill >= max_fill (1.0)
#   3. Neural models use this prediction during route construction
#
# USE CASES:
#   - Temporal environments (CWCVRP, SDWCVRP) with multi-day simulation
#   - Preventing overflows in stochastic demand scenarios
#   - Default strategy for most neural policies
#
# PARAMETERS:
#   - current_collection_day: Day to predict from (0 = today)
#     Range: 0-14 (0 = immediate lookahead, 7 = week ahead)
