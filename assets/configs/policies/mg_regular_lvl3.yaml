# =============================================================================
# Must-Go Strategy: Regular (Periodic Collection)
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE:
#   Fixed-frequency collection schedule - collect every N days regardless
#   of fill level. Traditional waste collection approach.
#
# ALGORITHM:
#   1. Track days since last collection for each bin
#   2. Mark bin as must-go if days_since_collection >= frequency
#   3. Deterministic, no fill-level awareness
#
# USE CASES:
#   - Baseline for comparison against adaptive strategies
#   - Regulatory compliance (mandatory collection intervals)
#   - Areas with predictable waste generation
#
# PARAMETERS:
#   - frequency: 3 (collect every 3 days)
#     Range: 1-7 (1 = daily, 7 = weekly)
#     lvl3 = every 3 days
# =============================================================================

strategy: regular
frequency: 3
max_fill: 100.0
