# Post-Processing: Fast TSP
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE:
#   Apply fast TSP solver (Christofides + 2-opt) to refine constructed routes.
#   Optimizes node sequencing within each route independently.
#
# ALGORITHM:
#   1. For each route in solution:
#      a. Extract route as TSP instance
#      b. Apply Christofides heuristic (MST-based construction)
#      c. Improve with 2-opt local search
#      d. Replace original route with improved sequence
#   2. Return refined multi-route solution
#
# USE CASES:
#   - Refine neural policy outputs (AM, TAM often produce suboptimal sequences)
#   - Quick polish after constructive heuristics
#   - Default post-processing for most policies
#
# PERFORMANCE:
#   - Very fast: <0.1s per route for 50 nodes
#   - Improvement: Typically 2-5% cost reduction
#
# PARAMETERS:
#   - methods: [fast_tsp] - Single-method post-processing pipeline
#   - n_routes: Number of routes to optimize (implicitly all routes)
