# Must-Go Strategy: Regular (4-Day Cycle)
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE:
#   Fixed-frequency collection every 4 days. Slightly less frequent than
#   lvl3 - trades collection frequency for reduced operational costs.
#
# ALGORITHM:
#   1. Track days since last collection for each bin
#   2. Mark bin as must-go if days_since_collection >= 4
#   3. Deterministic schedule
#
# USE CASES:
#   - Moderate waste generation areas
#   - Cost optimization (fewer trips than 3-day cycle)
#   - Benchmarking different collection frequencies
#
# PARAMETERS:
#   - frequency: 4 (collect every 4 days)
#     lvl4 = every 4 days
# =============================================================================

strategy: regular
frequency: 4
max_fill: 100.0
