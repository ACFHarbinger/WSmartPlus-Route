# Vehicle Routing Problem with Profits (VRPP) Environment Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Classic prize-collecting routing problem:
#   - Each node has a profit/prize
#   - No capacity constraints (uncapacitated)
#   - Maximize: total_prize - travel_cost
#
# Benchmark problem for testing neural constructive heuristics.

  # Problem Size
  # =============================================================================
  num_loc:
    50 # Number of customer nodes (excluding depot).
    # Standard benchmark sizes: 20, 50, 100, 200.
    # Total nodes = num_loc + 1 (includes depot at index 0).

  # =============================================================================
  # Objective Function Weights
  # =============================================================================
  # Objective: maximize (prize_weight × Σ prizes) - (cost_weight × total_distance)
  reward:
    waste_weight:
      1.0 # Weight for node prizes/rewards. (prize_weight in user's request)
      # Higher = prioritize collecting high-value nodes.
      # Typical range: 0.5-2.0.

    cost_weight:
      1.0 # Weight for travel distance penalty.
      # Higher = prioritize shorter routes.
      # Typical range: 0.5-2.0.
      #
      # Balance Examples:
      #   - prize_weight=1.0, cost_weight=1.0: Balanced (default)
      #   - prize_weight=2.0, cost_weight=1.0: Prioritize collecting nodes
      #   - prize_weight=1.0, cost_weight=2.0: Prioritize short routes
