# Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Profits (CVRPP) Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Prize-collecting routing WITH vehicle capacity constraints.
#
# Combines:
#   - VRPP: Prize/profit collection objective
#   - CVRP: Capacity constraints
#
# Realistic variant where vehicle has limited capacity and must return
# to depot to empty before continuing collection.
#
# Benchmark: Standard OR problem for testing capacity-aware algorithms.
# =============================================================================

env:
  name: "cvrpp"  # Environment identifier
  num_loc: 50  # Number of customer nodes. Standard sizes: 20, 50, 100, 200.

  # =============================================================================
  # Capacity Constraint
  # =============================================================================
  capacity: 1.0  # Normalized vehicle capacity.
                 # Prize values typically sum to > capacity, forcing selective collection.
                 # Range: 0.5-2.0. Higher = less constrained routing.

  # =============================================================================
  # Objective Function Weights
  # =============================================================================
  # Objective: maximize (prize_weight × Σ prizes) - (cost_weight × total_distance)
  # Subject to: vehicle capacity constraints

  prize_weight: 1.0  # Weight for node prizes/rewards. Higher = prioritize high-value nodes.
  cost_weight: 1.0  # Weight for travel distance. Higher = prioritize shorter routes.
