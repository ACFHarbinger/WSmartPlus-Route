# =============================================================================
# Must-Go Strategy: Regular (5-Day Cycle)
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE:
#   Least frequent periodic schedule - collect every 5 days. Minimizes
#   collection frequency but suitable only for low waste generation rates.
#
# ALGORITHM:
#   1. Track days since last collection for each bin
#   2. Mark bin as must-go if days_since_collection >= 5
#   3. Deterministic schedule
#
# USE CASES:
#   - Low waste generation areas (rural, residential)
#   - Maximum cost reduction scenarios
#   - Comparison baseline for high-frequency strategies
#
# PARAMETERS:
#   - frequency: 5 (collect every 5 days)
#     lvl5 = every 5 days (weekly work schedule)
# =============================================================================

strategy: regular
frequency: 5
max_fill: 100.0
