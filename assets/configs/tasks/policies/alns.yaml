# =============================================================================
# ALNS Expert Policy Configuration for RL Training
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE:
#   Configuration for using Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) as
#   expert policy in Imitation Learning or Adaptive Imitation Learning.
#
# USAGE:
#   python main.py train rl.imitation.policy_config=tasks/policies/rl/alns
# =============================================================================

_target_: logic.src.configs.rl.policies.ALNSConfig

# Runtime Control
time_limit: 30.0
# Maximum wall-clock seconds for ALNS solver
# Range: 10-60 (10s = fast, 30s = balanced, 60s = high quality)

# Search Parameters
max_iterations: 10000
# Maximum number of destroy-repair iterations
# Range: 1000-25000 (adaptive stopping typically halts earlier)

# Temperature Schedule (Simulated Annealing)
start_temp: 100.0
# Initial acceptance temperature for worse solutions
# Range: 50-200 (higher = more exploration)

cooling_rate: 0.995
# Temperature decay per iteration (T_new = T_old * cooling_rate)
# Range: 0.98-0.9999 (lower = faster cooling)

# Operator Weights
weight_update_frequency: 50
# Update operator weights every N iterations based on performance
# Range: 25-100

# Removal Parameters
max_removal_pct: 0.3
# Maximum percentage of solution to remove in destroy phase
# Range: 0.1-0.5 (0.2 = conservative, 0.3 = balanced, 0.5 = aggressive)

min_removal_pct: 0.1
# Minimum percentage of solution to remove
# Range: 0.05-0.2

# Vehicle Constraints
max_vehicles: 0
# Maximum number of vehicles (0 = unlimited)
