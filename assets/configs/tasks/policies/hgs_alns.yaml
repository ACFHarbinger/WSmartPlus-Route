# =============================================================================
# HGS-ALNS Hybrid Expert Policy Configuration for RL Training
# =============================================================================
# PURPOSE:
#   Configuration for using HGS-ALNS hybrid as expert policy in Imitation
#   Learning or Adaptive Imitation Learning.
#
# USAGE:
#   python main.py train rl.imitation.policy_config=tasks/policies/rl/hgs_alns
# =============================================================================

_target_: logic.src.configs.rl.policies.HGSALNSConfig

# Runtime Control
time_limit: 30.0
# Maximum wall-clock seconds for full HGS-ALNS pipeline
# Range: 20-60 (20s = fast, 30s = balanced, 60s = high quality)
# Note: Shared between HGS phase and ALNS education phase

# HGS Population Management
population_size: 50
# Total individuals in genetic pool
# Range: 25-100

elite_size: 10
# Number of solutions to "educate" with ALNS
# Range: 5-25 (typically 20% of population_size)
# Only elite solutions undergo ALNS refinement

# Genetic Operators
mutation_rate: 0.2
# Probability of mutation after crossover in HGS phase
# Range: 0.0-0.5

# ALNS Education Phase
alns_education_iterations: 50
# Number of destroy-repair cycles applied to each elite solution
# Range: 10-200 (10 = light polish, 50 = balanced, 100 = deep search)
# Higher values → better solutions but slower training

# Evolution Control
n_generations: 100
# Maximum number of HGS generations
# Range: 50-200

# Vehicle Constraints
max_vehicles: 0
# Maximum number of vehicles (0 = unlimited)
