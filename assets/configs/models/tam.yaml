# @package _global_
# =============================================================================
# Temporal Attention Model (TAM) Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Extension of the Attention Model for multi-day routing problems with temporal
# dynamics (e.g., WCVRP, SDWCVRP).
#
# Key Features:
#   - Temporal horizon for future waste prediction
#   - GRF (Gated Recurrent Flow) predictor for bin fill forecasting
#   - Time-aware attention mechanisms
#
# Best For: WCVRP, SDWCVRP (multi-day waste collection)
# Not Needed For: VRPP, CVRPP (static single-day problems)
# =============================================================================

model:
  name: "tam"  # Model identifier
  embed_dim: 128  # Node embedding dimension (same as AM)
  hidden_dim: 512  # Feed-forward hidden size (same as AM)

  # Temporal-Specific Parameters
  # =============================================================================
  temporal_horizon: 7  # Number of days to forecast ahead for bin fill prediction.
                       # Range: 3-14 days. Higher = better long-term planning but slower.
                       # Typical values:
                       #   - 7: Standard (1 week ahead)
                       #   - 14: Long-term planning (2 weeks)
                       #   - 3: Short-term reactive
