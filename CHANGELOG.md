## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-twenty-third pass (§G.7 + §G.9 + §G.10 + §G.14 + §G.15 + §G.17 + §D.7 + §D.8)

Two-hundred-and-twenty-third pass extends path-handoff surface parity beyond
``.jsonl`` dual Summary / Monitor icons (pass 222). Process rows, live-panel
footers, and Command Palette recents now hand off training dirs, run roots,
CSVs, checkpoints, and configs via a shared ``PathHandoffButtons`` control.
Train/HPO completion toasts gain dual **Training** + **Output** actions when
stdout yields both artefacts.

**React frontend**
- ``PathHandoffButtons`` — kind-aware handoffs (log dual + single-icon non-log) (§G.7 / §G.14 / §G.15 / §G.17 / §D.7)
- Process Monitor process rows — non-log path chips use ``PathHandoffButtons`` (§G.15 / §G.10 / §G.17 / §D.7)
- ``ProcessIdFooter`` — path-kind handoffs for training / run / log chips (§G.9 / §G.15 / §D.7)
- Command Palette — recent entries of all known kinds show icon handoffs (§G.7 / §D.7)
- Process train/HPO toasts — dual **Training** + **Output** when both paths present (§D.8 / §G.17 / §G.14 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.15 / §G.7 non-log path-handoff surface parity checked
- §D.8 train/HPO dual toast actions documented
- §D.7 path-kind handoff coverage checked

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-twenty-second pass (§G.1 + §G.9 + §G.14 + §G.15 + §G.16 + §G.17 + §D.7 + §D.8)

Two-hundred-and-twenty-second pass continues log-handoff surface parity after pass 221
put dual handoffs on Process Monitor rows and Command Palette recents. Live-panel
``ProcessIdFooter`` path chips now expose the same Summary / Monitor icons when the
stdout-derived path is a ``.jsonl``, covering Simulation Launcher and Process Monitor
sim panels without relying on the nav mesh alone. Process terminal toasts gain action
buttons that open the matching artefact (Summary + Monitor for logs, Training for
train/HPO runs, Output Browser for run roots) via a new store-based handoff helper.

**React frontend**
- ``applyStoreRecentHandoff`` / ``recentPendingSettersFromStore`` for non-React handoffs (§G.7 / §D.7 / §D.8)
- ``ProcessIdFooter`` — ``LogHandoffButtons`` when ``logPath`` is ``.jsonl`` (§G.9 / §G.15 / §G.1 / §G.16 / §D.7)
- Process completion / failure / cancel toasts — Summary / Monitor / Training / Output actions (§D.8 / §G.1 / §G.14 / §G.16 / §G.17 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.9 / §G.15 live-panel footer log-handoff surface parity checked
- §D.8 toast handoff actions + Option A+B status documented
- §D.7 process-footer + toast log-handoff coverage checked

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-twenty-first pass (§G.1 + §G.7 + §G.15 + §G.16 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-twenty-first pass continues log-handoff surface parity after pass 220
put dual handoffs on the Output Browser run-select tree header. Process Monitor process
rows expose icon Summary / Monitor controls when the stdout-derived path is a ``.jsonl``
so live/recent sims can open analytics without expanding the process first. Command
Palette recent log entries gain the same dual icons for explicit Summary vs Digital Twin
open (``onAfterOpen`` closes the palette after handoff).

**React frontend**
- ``LogHandoffButtons`` optional ``onAfterOpen`` callback (§G.1 / §G.7 / §D.7)
- Process Monitor — process-row ``LogHandoffButtons`` when ``logPath`` is ``.jsonl`` (§G.15 / §G.1 / §G.16 / §D.7)
- Command Palette — recent log dual handoffs + close after open (§G.7 / §G.1 / §G.16 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.15 / §G.7 process-row + palette recent-log handoff surface parity checked
- §D.7 process list and command-palette log-handoff coverage checked

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-twentieth pass (§G.1 + §G.14 + §G.16 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-twentieth pass closes the Output Browser run-select log-handoff gap
left after pass 218 put dual handoffs on the JSONL file viewer. Selecting a run that
has a discovered ``runJsonlPath`` now shows icon Summary / Monitor controls on the
file-tree header so analytics can open without browsing into the log file first.

**React frontend**
- Output Browser — selected-run tree header ``LogHandoffButtons`` when ``runJsonlPath`` known (§G.14 / §G.1 / §G.16 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.14 run-select log-handoff surface parity with JSONL file viewer checked
- §D.7 Output Browser run-header handoff coverage checked

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-nineteenth pass (§G.1 + §G.9 + §G.15 + §G.16 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-nineteenth pass continues the shared log-handoff control migration
after pass 218 covered analytics toolbars. ``LogHandoffButtons`` accepts an optional
``path`` so launcher nav can still open Summary / Monitor before a ``.jsonl`` is
emitted. ``LauncherNavMesh`` replaces inline sim handoff markup with the shared
labeled control (Monitor-only while running; Summary + Monitor when post-run).

**React frontend**
- ``LogHandoffButtons`` optional ``path`` — mode-only navigation without handoff (§G.1 / §G.16 / §D.7)
- ``LauncherNavMesh`` — sim Summary / Monitor via shared labeled control (§G.9 / §G.15 / §D.7)
- Simulation Launcher + Process Monitor — inherit nav-mesh log handoffs via ``simLogPath`` (§G.9 / §G.15 / §G.16 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.9 / §G.15 launcher nav-mesh ``LogHandoffButtons`` migration checked
- §D.7 empty-path log-handoff navigation coverage checked

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-eighteenth pass (§G.1 + §G.14 + §G.16 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-eighteenth pass completes the shared log-handoff control migration
left after pass 217 introduced ``LogHandoffButtons``. A ``targets`` prop supports
Summary-only / Monitor-only toolbars so pages that already host one view avoid a
redundant sibling button. Simulation Monitor, Algorithm Comparison, Simulation
Summary, and Output Browser JSONL viewer now use the shared control.

**React frontend**
- ``LogHandoffButtons`` ``targets`` — single-direction toolbars (§G.1 / §G.16 / §D.7)
- Simulation Monitor / Algorithm Comparison — Summary via shared control (§G.16 / §G.1 / §D.7)
- Simulation Summary — Monitor via shared control (§G.1 / §G.16 / §D.7)
- Output Browser — JSONL dual handoffs via shared labeled control (§G.14 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.1 / §G.14 / §G.16 studio-wide ``LogHandoffButtons`` toolbar migration checked
- §D.7 single-direction handoff target coverage checked

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-seventeenth pass (§G.1 + §G.6 + §G.16 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-seventeenth pass extracts shared log-handoff controls after passes
214–216 repeated Summary / Monitor button markup across portfolio rows and toolbars.
``LogHandoffButtons`` supports dense icon rows and labeled toolbar buttons via the
shared mode override. ``LoadedRunRow`` delegates to it. OLAP Explorer surfaces
labeled Summary + Monitor handoffs when the selected ingest path is a ``.jsonl``
simulation log.

**React frontend**
- ``LogHandoffButtons`` / ``isSimulationLogPath`` — shared Summary + Monitor handoffs (§G.1 / §G.16 / §D.7)
- ``LoadedRunRow`` — ``logHandoffs`` via shared control (§G.1 / §D.7)
- OLAP Explorer — labeled log handoffs for JSONL ingest paths (§G.6 / §G.1 / §G.16 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.6 / §G.1 / §G.16 shared log-handoff control + OLAP JSONL path parity checked
- §D.7 handoff control deduplication checked

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-sixteenth pass (§G.1 + §G.16 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-sixteenth pass closes the open-log Simulation Summary handoff gap left
after pass 215 wired portfolio row handoffs and pass 214 exposed Monitor handoffs from
Summary, Output Browser, and Algorithm Comparison. Simulation Monitor gains **Simulation
Summary →** for the open ``watchPath``. Algorithm Comparison exposes the same Summary
handoff next to **Compare on Map** so analytics can jump either direction without
re-picking the log.

**React frontend**
- Simulation Monitor — **Simulation Summary →** open-log handoff (§G.16 / §G.1 / §D.7)
- Algorithm Comparison — **Simulation Summary →** ``watchPath`` handoff (§G.1 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.16 / §G.1 open-log Simulation Summary handoff parity checked
- §D.7 reverse open-log Summary surface coverage beyond portfolio rows checked

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-fifteenth pass (§G.1 + §G.1.6 + §G.16 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-fifteenth pass closes the portfolio loaded-run log-handoff gap left after
pass 214 exposed Simulation Monitor mode override on Output Browser, Summary, and
Algorithm Comparison. ``LoadedRunRow`` gains optional ``logHandoffs`` controls that open
a run in Simulation Summary or Digital Twin via the shared handoff helper. Benchmark
Analysis, City Comparison, and Simulation Summary comparison lists enable the controls
so multi-run analytics can jump to per-run map/summary views without re-picking files.

**React frontend**
- ``LoadedRunRow`` — optional Summary + Simulation Monitor log handoffs (§G.1 / §G.16 / §D.7)
- Benchmark Analysis — portfolio loaded-run log handoffs (§G.1 / §D.7)
- City Comparison — portfolio loaded-run log handoffs (§G.1.6 / §D.7)
- Simulation Summary — comparison-run log handoffs (§G.1 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.1 / §G.1.6 portfolio loaded-run Simulation Monitor / Summary handoff parity checked
- §D.7 mode-override coverage on portfolio run lists checked

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-fourteenth pass (§G.1 + §G.14 + §G.16 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-fourteenth pass closes the analytics/file-browser Simulation Monitor
log-handoff gap left after pass 213 introduced the ``mode`` override on nav meshes and
the Command Palette. Output Browser gains **Open in Simulation Monitor →** next to
Summary for ``.jsonl`` files. Simulation Summary exposes **Simulation Monitor →** for
the open log. Algorithm Comparison **Compare on Map** hands off ``watchPath`` with
``mode: "simulation"`` so the Digital Twin reloads the log and recent-file labels stay
aligned with brush/SQL.

**React frontend**
- Output Browser — **Open in Simulation Monitor →** log handoff mode override (§G.14 / §G.16 / §D.7)
- Simulation Summary — **Simulation Monitor →** open-log Digital Twin handoff (§G.1 / §G.16 / §D.7)
- Algorithm Comparison — **Compare on Map** ``watchPath`` handoff + map-compare intent (§G.16 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.14 / §G.1 / §G.16 analytics + Output Browser Simulation Monitor log-handoff parity checked
- §D.7 mode-override surface coverage beyond launcher nav mesh checked

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-thirteenth pass (§G.1 + §G.6 + §G.7 + §G.9–§G.17 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-thirteenth pass closes the post-run Simulation Monitor (Digital Twin)
log-handoff gap left after pass 212 wired Summary navigation only. ``applyRecentHandoff``
/ ``handoff`` accept an optional ``mode`` override so the same ``pendingLogPath`` can open
in Summary or Monitor. ``LauncherNavMesh`` **Simulation Monitor →** pushes recents and
sets ``pendingLogPath`` when ``simLogPath`` is present. Command Palette log open uses the
shared handoff (Summary on successful load, Monitor fallback). Remaining local-open and
portfolio multi-select call sites use ``handoff(…, { navigate: false })`` instead of
inline ``pushRecent(makeRecentEntry(…))``.

**React frontend**
- ``applyRecentHandoff`` / ``useRecentHandoff.handoff`` — optional ``mode`` override (§G.7 / §G.16 / §D.7)
- ``LauncherNavMesh`` — post-run **Simulation Monitor →** log handoff (§G.9 / §G.16 / §D.7)
- Command Palette — log open via shared handoff + mode fallback (§G.7 / §G.1 / §G.16 / §D.7)
- Local-open migration to ``handoff(navigate: false)`` across launchers, monitors, analytics, Output Browser, global drop (§G.1 / §G.6 / §G.10–§G.17 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.16 / §G.9 post-run Simulation Monitor log handoff checked
- §G.7 / §D.7 handoff mode override + studio-wide ``navigate: false`` recent-file parity checked

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-twelfth pass (§G.1 + §G.7 + §G.8 + §G.9 + §G.14 + §G.15 + §G.17 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-twelfth pass closes the post-run Simulation Summary log-handoff gap
left after pass 211 unified ``applyRecentHandoff`` without wiring completed-sim
``.jsonl`` paths into Summary navigation. ``useRecentHandoff`` consolidates
pending-path setters and the shared ``handoff(path, kind)`` helper across nav meshes,
Command Palette, global drop, wsroute import, Output Browser, and Training Monitor.
``LauncherNavMesh`` accepts ``simLogPath`` so **Simulation Summary →** and the
Simulation Launcher auto-Summary countdown push recents and set ``pendingLogPath``.

**React frontend**
- ``useRecentHandoff`` / ``useRecentPendingSetters`` — shared handoff hook (§G.7 / §G.8 / §D.7)
- ``LauncherNavMesh`` ``simLogPath`` — post-run Summary log handoff (§G.9 / §G.1 / §D.7)
- Simulation Launcher — auto-nav + nav mesh ``simJsonlPath`` via ``extractJsonlPathFromLogLines`` (§G.9 / §D.7)
- Process Monitor — sim panel Summary handoff from stdout ``.jsonl`` (§G.15 / §G.9 / §D.7)
- Call-site migration to ``handoff()`` (nav meshes, palette, drop, import, Output Browser, Training Monitor) (§G.7–§G.15 / §G.17 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.9 / §G.1 post-run Simulation Summary log handoff checked
- §G.7 / §G.8 shared ``useRecentHandoff`` hook parity checked
- §D.7 Shared handoff hook relative-path brush/SQL recent-file parity checked

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-eleventh pass (§G.1 + §G.6 + §G.7 + §G.8 + §G.9–§G.14 + §G.16 + §G.17 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-eleventh pass closes the studio-wide recent-file helper gap left after
pass 210 introduced ``makeRecentEntry`` / ``recentHandoffSpec`` without migrating all
call sites. ``applyRecentHandoff`` centralises push + pending-path + mode navigation.
``LauncherNavMesh``, ``TrainHpoNavMesh``, Output Browser handoff buttons, Command Palette,
global drop, wsroute import, and Training Monitor checkpoint load use the shared helper.
All remaining page-level ``pushRecent({… portfolioRunLabel …})`` call sites now use
``makeRecentEntry`` for Command Palette brush/SQL label parity.

**React frontend**
- ``applyRecentHandoff`` — shared push + pending-path + mode handoff (§G.7 / §G.8 / §D.7)
- ``LauncherNavMesh`` + ``TrainHpoNavMesh`` — post-run handoffs via ``applyRecentHandoff`` (§G.9–§G.12 / §G.15 / §G.17 / §D.7)
- Output Browser — sim/eval/config/csv/bundle handoffs via ``applyRecentHandoff`` (§G.14 / §D.7)
- Command Palette / global drop / wsroute import / Training Monitor checkpoint via shared handoff (§G.7 / §G.8 / §G.17 / §D.7)
- Analytics + launcher + monitor + Config Editor ``pushRecent`` → ``makeRecentEntry`` (§G.1 / §G.6 / §G.10 / §G.12 / §G.13 / §G.16 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.7 / §G.8 / §G.14 studio-wide ``makeRecentEntry`` / ``applyRecentHandoff`` parity checked
- §G.9–§G.12 / §G.15 / §G.17 nav-mesh recent-file handoff shared helper checked
- §D.7 Shared handoff helper relative-path brush/SQL recent-file parity checked

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-tenth pass (§G.6 + §G.7 + §G.8 + §G.10 + §G.12 + §G.14 + §G.17 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-tenth pass closes the shared recent-file handoff and directory-drop
gaps left after pass 209 introduced ``recentKindFromPath`` without wiring it through
call sites. ``recentHandoff.ts`` centralises kind → mode / pending-path / toast specs
and ``makeRecentEntry`` for ``portfolioRunLabel`` labels. Command Palette opens all
recent kinds via the shared handoff and keyboard-navigates recents with commands.
``useGlobalFileDrop`` classifies every dropped path (including training ``logs/`` and
``assets/output`` run directories), pushes all matches to recents, and navigates to the
highest-priority artefact. Output Browser directory picker and eval/train CSV dataset
pickers push recents for Command Palette reopen parity.

**React frontend**
- ``recentHandoff.ts`` — shared handoff specs + ``makeRecentEntry`` + drop priority (§G.7 / §G.8 / §D.7)
- ``recentKindFromPath`` — training ``logs/`` + ``assets/output`` run directory heuristics (§G.8 / §G.14 / §G.17 / §D.7)
- Command Palette — unified recent open + keyboard nav over recents and commands (§G.7 / §D.7)
- ``useGlobalFileDrop`` — multi-path classify/push + directory drop + shared handoff (§G.8 / §G.6 / §G.12 / §G.14 / §G.17 / §D.7)
- Output Browser — ``pickOutputDir`` + inline open via ``recentKindFromPath`` / ``makeRecentEntry`` (§G.14 / §D.7)
- Evaluation Runner + Training Hub — CSV dataset pick ``pushRecent`` (§G.12 / §G.10 / §G.6 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.7 Command Palette shared recent handoff + keyboard nav checked
- §G.8 Global multi-path + directory drop recent-file parity checked
- §G.14 Output Browser directory-open recent-file parity checked
- §G.6 / §G.10 / §G.12 CSV dataset pick recent-file handoff checked
- §D.7 Shared handoff relative-path brush/SQL recent-file parity checked

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-ninth pass (§G.6 + §G.7 + §G.8 + §G.12 + §G.13 + §G.14 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-ninth pass closes the global file-drop and Output Browser multi-kind
gaps left after pass 208 unified Config Editor recent-file handoffs. ``recentKindFromPath``
classifies filesystem paths into recent-file kinds. ``useGlobalFileDrop`` routes dropped
``.csv``, checkpoint (``.pt`` / ``.ckpt`` / ``.pth``), and config files through the same
``portfolioRunLabel`` + pending-path handoffs used by Command Palette recents. Output
Browser pushes checkpoints on inline open and adds **Open in Data Explorer →** for CSV
via ``pendingCsvPath``.

**React frontend**
- ``recentFiles`` store — ``recentKindFromPath`` path → kind classifier (§G.7 / §G.8 / §D.7)
- ``useGlobalFileDrop`` — multi-kind drop for log / csv / checkpoint / config with ``portfolioRunLabel`` + pending handoffs (§G.8 / §G.6 / §G.12 / §G.13 / §D.7)
- Output Browser — inline checkpoint open ``pushRecent`` via ``portfolioRunLabel`` (§G.14 / §G.12 / §D.7)
- Output Browser — **Open in Data Explorer →** CSV handoff via ``pendingCsvPath`` (§G.14 / §G.6 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.8 Global file drop multi-kind recent-file ``portfolioRunLabel`` parity checked
- §G.14 Output Browser checkpoint open + Data Explorer CSV handoff recent-file parity checked
- §G.6 / §G.12 / §G.13 Data Explorer / Eval Runner / Config Editor drop handoff checked
- §D.7 Global drop + Output Browser multi-kind relative-path brush/SQL recent-file parity checked

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-eighth pass (§G.7 + §G.13 + §G.14 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-eighth pass closes the Config Editor recent-file gaps left after
pass 207 unified eval-checkpoint handoff labels. ``RecentFileKind`` gains
``config`` for YAML / TOML / cfg / ini files. Configuration Editor file picker and
``pendingConfigPath`` consume push recent files via ``portfolioRunLabel``. Output
Browser pushes on inline config open and adds **Open in Config Editor →** via
``pendingConfigPath``. Command Palette opens config recents into Config Editor.

**React frontend**
- ``recentFiles`` store — ``config`` kind for Hydra / YAML config files (§G.13 / §G.7 / §D.7)
- App store — ``pendingConfigPath`` deep-link for Config Editor handoff (§G.13 / §G.14 / §D.7)
- Configuration Editor — file picker + ``pendingConfigPath`` consume ``pushRecent`` via ``portfolioRunLabel`` (§G.13 / §D.7)
- Output Browser — inline config open ``pushRecent`` + **Open in Config Editor →** handoff (§G.14 / §G.13 / §D.7)
- Command Palette — recent config handoff via ``pendingConfigPath`` (§G.7 / §G.13 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.13 Configuration Editor recent-file ``portfolioRunLabel`` parity checked
- §G.7 Command Palette config recent-file handoff checked

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-seventh pass (§G.7 + §G.10 + §G.12 + §G.14 + §G.17 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-seventh pass closes the eval-checkpoint recent-file gaps left after
pass 206 unified Training Monitor and nav-mesh handoff labels. ``RecentFileKind``
gains ``checkpoint`` for ``.pt`` / ``.ckpt`` / ``.pth`` model files. Training Monitor
checkpoint browser, Output Browser ``loadInEvalRunner``, and ``LauncherNavMesh``
post-run ``Load in Eval Runner`` push recent files via ``portfolioRunLabel`` before
``pendingCheckpoint`` handoff. Evaluation Runner and Training Hub file pickers and
``pendingCheckpoint`` consume use the same labels. Command Palette opens checkpoint
recents into Evaluation Runner.

**React frontend**
- ``recentFiles`` store — ``checkpoint`` kind for model checkpoint files (§G.12 / §G.7 / §D.7)
- Training Monitor — checkpoint browser ``pushRecent`` via ``portfolioRunLabel`` on eval handoff (§G.17 / §G.12 / §D.7)
- Output Browser — ``loadInEvalRunner`` ``pushRecent`` via ``portfolioRunLabel`` (§G.14 / §G.12 / §D.7)
- ``LauncherNavMesh`` — post-run eval checkpoint handoff ``pushRecent`` via ``portfolioRunLabel`` (§G.9–§G.12 / §G.15 / §D.7)

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-sixth pass (§G.7 + §G.9–§G.12 + §G.15 + §G.17 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-sixth pass closes the Training Monitor and launcher/train-HPO
nav-mesh recent-file gaps left after pass 205 unified Command Palette label
refresh and Output Browser inline open. ``RecentFileKind`` gains ``training``
for Lightning log directories. Training Monitor pushes recent files via
``portfolioRunLabel`` on run select, ``pendingTrainingRunPath`` consume, and
post-run auto-select. Command Palette opens training recents into Training
Monitor; ``LauncherNavMesh`` and ``TrainHpoNavMesh`` push Output Browser /
Training Monitor handoff paths with the same relative-path labels.

**React frontend**
- ``recentFiles`` store — ``training`` kind for Lightning log directories (§G.17 / §G.7 / §D.7)
- Training Monitor — ``pushRecent`` via ``portfolioRunLabel`` on select / pending / post-run auto-select; filter-bar ``portfolioRunLabel`` parity (§G.17 / §D.7)
- Command Palette — recent training handoff via ``pendingTrainingRunPath`` (§G.7 / §G.17 / §D.7)
- ``LauncherNavMesh`` + ``TrainHpoNavMesh`` — Output Browser / Training Monitor handoff ``pushRecent`` via ``portfolioRunLabel`` (§G.9–§G.12 / §G.15 / §G.17 / §D.7)

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-fifth pass (§G.6 + §G.7 + §G.8 + §G.14 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-fifth pass closes the Command Palette on-open label refresh and
Output Browser inline file-open recent-file gaps left after pass 204 unified
portfolio load and bundle/drop handoff labels. ``refreshRecentLabels`` re-derives
persisted recent log/run/csv labels via ``portfolioRunLabel`` when the palette
opens or ``projectRoot`` changes. Command Palette CSV entries hand off through
``pendingCsvPath``; Output Browser inline ``.jsonl`` / ``.csv`` tree opens push
recent files with ``portfolioRunLabel``.

**React frontend**
- ``recentFiles`` store — ``refreshRecentLabels`` via ``portfolioRunLabel`` on palette open / ``projectRoot`` change (§G.7 / §D.7)
- Command Palette — ``refreshRecentLabels`` on open; ``pendingCsvPath`` handoff for recent CSV (§G.7 / §G.6 / §D.7)
- Data Explorer — consume ``pendingCsvPath`` on mount for Command Palette CSV parity (§G.6 / §D.7)
- Output Browser — ``pushRecent`` on inline ``.jsonl`` / ``.csv`` file open via ``portfolioRunLabel`` (§G.14 / §G.8 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**
- §G.7 Command Palette on-open recent-file label refresh checked
- §G.6 Data Explorer ``pendingCsvPath`` Command Palette CSV handoff checked

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — two-hundred-and-fourth pass (§G.1 + §G.1.6 + §G.7 + §G.8 + §G.14 + §D.7)

Two-hundred-and-fourth pass closes the portfolio load, bundle/drop import, and
Simulation Summary handoff recent-file ``run_label`` gaps left after pass 203
unified compare handoff and add-run Command Palette labels. ``portfolioRunLabel``
now drives ``pushRecent`` on Output Browser ``openInSimSummary`` /
``extractBundleAndOpen``, global ``.jsonl`` / ``.wsroute`` drop and import hooks,

Hundred-ninety-fifth pass closes the portfolio and open-file relative-path resolution
gaps left after the hundred-ninety-fourth pass (which added ``PathRunLabelChip``
store fallback and explicit ``projectRoot`` on analysis/monitor/file browsers).
``useLogPathRunLabelBrush`` and ``LoadedRunRow`` now resolve paths against

Hundred-ninety-fourth pass closes the analysis/monitor/file-browser relative-path
resolution gaps left after the hundred-ninety-third pass (which unified launcher
workflow ``PathRunLabelChip`` ``projectRoot`` parity). ``PathRunLabelChip`` now
falls back to the persisted ``useAppStore`` project root when the prop is omitted,

Hundred-seventy-second pass closes the launcher and monitor card-header run-label gap left
after the hundred-seventy-first pass (which unified Process Monitor embedded run-label
suffixes). All workflow live panels now show accent-secondary run labels and · live suffixes
in card headers, with shared global ``run_label`` brush sync via ``useProcessRunLabelBrush``.

**React frontend**
- ``useProcessRunLabelBrush`` — shared hook deriving ``run_label`` from process stdout and
  syncing the global brush (§G.9–§G.18 / §D.7)
- ``LauncherLivePanelHeader`` — ``runLabel`` + ``showLiveSuffix`` on card variant headers
  (§G.9 / §G.11 / §G.12 / §G.10 / §D.7)
- ``TrainHpoLivePanelHeader`` — ``runLabel`` + ``showLiveSuffix`` on split and inline card
  layouts (§G.10 / §G.15 / §G.17 / §G.18 / §D.7)
- Simulation Launcher + Data Generation + Evaluation Runner + Training Hub — pass ``runLabel``
  to live panel headers; ``GlobalFilterBar`` ``runLabels`` when a process is active
  (§G.9 / §G.10 / §G.11 / §G.12 / §D.7)
- Training Monitor + HPO Tracker + Experiment Tracker — pass ``runLabel`` + ``showLiveSuffix``

Hundred-seventy-first pass closes the Process Monitor embedded run-label and live-suffix
gap left after the hundred-seventieth pass (which unified train/HPO live panel titles).
Eval, data-gen, and train/HPO embedded sections now match the sim panel's muted subtitle
header with run label and · live suffix; global run brush sync applies to all workflow kinds.

**React frontend**
- ``TrainHpoLivePanelHeader`` — ``runLabel`` prop for embedded run-label suffix parity with
  ``LauncherLivePanelHeader`` (§G.15 / §D.7)
- ``TrainHpoLivePanel`` — ``embedded`` variant defaults ``titleTone: muted`` +
  ``showLiveSuffix: true`` for train/HPO analytics subtitles (§G.15 / §D.7)

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — hundred-seventieth pass (§G.10 + §G.15 + §G.17 + §G.18 + §D.7)

Hundred-seventieth pass closes the train/HPO live panel title gap left after the
hundred-sixty-ninth pass (which unified sim and data-gen live panel titles). Training Hub,
Training Monitor, HPO Tracker, Experiment Tracker, and Process Monitor now share one title
helper per workflow kind for running, completed, and failed states.

**React frontend**
- ``trainHpoLivePanelTitle`` — shared live/post-run train/HPO panel title helper in
  ``trainingProcess.ts`` (§G.10 / §G.15 / §G.17 / §G.18 / §D.7)
- Training Hub + Training Monitor + HPO Tracker + Experiment Tracker — deduplicated inline
  train/HPO live title strings; import shared ``trainHpoLivePanelTitle`` (§G.10 / §G.17 / §G.18 / §D.7)
- Process Monitor — selected ``train_`` / ``hpo_`` embedded sections use dynamic
  ``trainHpoLivePanelTitle`` instead of static ``Training analytics`` subtitle
  (§G.10 / §G.15 / §G.17 / §G.18 / §D.7)

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — hundred-sixty-eighth pass (§G.10 + §G.12 + §G.15 + §D.7)

Hundred-sixty-eighth pass closes the eval live panel title gap left after the
hundred-sixty-seventh pass (which fixed Training Hub eval progress duplication and
added ``Training Hub →`` to eval ``LauncherNavMesh``). All three eval surfaces now
share one title helper for running, completed, and failed states.

**React frontend**
- ``evalLivePanelTitle`` — shared live/post-run eval panel title helper in
  ``evalResults.ts``; supports single- and multi-checkpoint batch wording
  (§G.10 / §G.12 / §G.15 / §D.7)
- Training Hub + Evaluation Runner — deduplicated inline eval live title strings;
  import shared ``evalLivePanelTitle`` (§G.10 / §G.12 / §D.7)

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — hundred-sixty-seventh pass (§G.10 + §G.12 + §G.15 + §D.7)

Hundred-sixty-seventh pass closes the eval progress and navigation gaps left after the
hundred-sixty-sixth pass (which routed Training Hub eval mode through
``LauncherLivePanel``). Single-checkpoint eval workflows no longer render a duplicate
``LiveTrainProgressBar`` at the panel shell level, and eval ``LauncherNavMesh`` now
links back to Training Hub from Evaluation Runner and Process Monitor.

**React frontend**
- Training Hub — eval live panel omits ``LauncherLivePanel`` ``progress`` prop;
  ``EvalCheckpointLiveCard`` owns the progress bar during runs (§G.10 / §G.12 / §D.7)
- ``LauncherNavMesh`` — ``Training Hub →`` shortcut on eval workflows; optional
  ``hideHub`` prop suppresses self-link on Training Hub eval panel (§G.10 / §G.12 / §G.15 / §D.7)

**ROADMAP**

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — hundred-sixty-sixth pass (§G.10 + §G.12 + §D.7)

Hundred-sixty-sixth pass closes the eval live panel shell gap left after the
hundred-sixty-fifth pass (which added ``LauncherLivePanel`` ``logLines`` shell
parity on Evaluation Runner and Process Monitor). Training Hub eval mode now uses
the shared launcher eval panel instead of ``TrainHpoLivePanel``, matching the
Evaluation Runner single-checkpoint pattern.

**React frontend**
- Training Hub — eval mode renders ``LauncherLivePanel`` + ``EvalCheckpointLiveCard``
  / ``EvalResultCard`` instead of ``TrainHpoLivePanel`` (§G.10 / §G.12 / §D.7)
- Training Hub — eval live panel passes ``logLines`` to shared ``LauncherLivePanel``
  shell; ``EvalCheckpointLiveCard`` omits inline tail via ``showLogTail={false}``
  (§G.10 / §G.12 / §D.7)
- Training Hub — eval ``LauncherNavMesh`` post-run shortcuts (Output Browser,
  Evaluation Runner reload, Benchmark Analysis) parity with Evaluation Runner
  (§G.10 / §G.12 / §D.7)

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — hundred-sixty-fifth pass (§G.12 + §G.15 + §D.7)

Hundred-sixty-fifth pass closes the eval log tail shell gap left after the
hundred-sixty-fourth pass (which added ``logLines`` props on ``LauncherLivePanel``
for sim/data-gen workflows). Single-checkpoint eval workflows now pass raw stdout
lines to ``LauncherLivePanel`` instead of rendering inline ``ProcessLogTail`` on
``EvalCheckpointLiveCard``, matching the sim/data-gen panel pattern. Multi-checkpoint
batch eval retains per-card compact tails.

**React frontend**
- ``EvalCheckpointLiveCard`` — optional ``showLogTail`` prop; omit inline tail when
  parent panel renders it (§G.12 / §D.7)
- Evaluation Runner — single-checkpoint live panel passes ``logLines`` to shared
  ``LauncherLivePanel`` shell; multi-checkpoint batch keeps per-card compact tails
  (§G.12 / §D.7)
- Process Monitor — selected ``eval`` embedded section passes ``logLines`` to
  ``LauncherLivePanel`` instead of inline ``ProcessLogTail`` on live card
  (§G.12 / §G.15 / §D.7)

Hundred-sixty-fourth pass closes the launcher log tail shell gap left after the
hundred-sixty-third pass (which added ``logLines`` props on ``TrainHpoLivePanel``).
Launcher workflows now pass raw stdout lines to ``LauncherLivePanel`` instead of
rendering inline ``ProcessLogTail`` children, matching the train/HPO panel pattern.

**React frontend**
- ``LauncherLivePanel`` — optional ``logLines`` + ``logTailWaiting`` props render
  shared ``ProcessLogTail`` below children (§G.9 / §G.11 / §G.15 / §D.7)
- Simulation Launcher — deduplicated inline ``ProcessLogTail`` child; pass

Hundred-sixty-third pass closes the train/HPO log tail display gap left after the
hundred-sixty-second pass (which added ``ProcessLogTail`` on Simulation Launcher,
Data Generation, Evaluation Runner, and Process Monitor sim/data-gen/eval
embedded sections). Train/HPO workflows now show the shared stdout tail via
``TrainHpoLivePanel`` across Training Hub, Training Monitor, HPO Tracker,
Experiment Tracker, and Process Monitor train/HPO embedded sections.

**React frontend**
- ``TrainHpoLivePanel`` — optional ``logLines`` + ``logTailWaiting`` props render
  shared ``ProcessLogTail`` below analytics strip (§G.10 / §G.15 / §G.17 / §G.18 / §D.7)
- Training Hub — ``ProcessLogTail`` in live progress panel during train/hpo/eval runs

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — hundred-sixty-second pass (§G.9 + §G.12 + §G.15 + §D.7)

Hundred-sixty-second pass closes the remaining launcher log tail display gaps left
after the hundred-sixty-first pass (which added ``ProcessLogTail`` on Data
Generation, ``EvalCheckpointLiveCard``, and Process Monitor ``gen_data``).
Simulation Launcher and Process Monitor ``test_sim`` embedded sections now show
the shared stdout tail, and ``EvalCheckpointLiveCard`` accepts raw ``logLines``
so callers no longer pre-format tails via ``processLogTail``.

**React frontend**
- ``EvalCheckpointLiveCard`` — accepts ``logLines`` + optional ``maxLines``;
  deduplicated ``processLogTail`` calls at Evaluation Runner and Process Monitor
  (§G.12 / §D.7)
- Simulation Launcher — ``ProcessLogTail`` in live status panel during ``test_sim``
  runs (§G.9 / §D.7)
- Process Monitor — selected ``test_sim`` processes show ``ProcessLogTail`` in
  embedded workflow section (§G.9 / §G.15 / §D.7)

Hundred-sixty-first pass closes the launcher log tail display gap left after the
hundred-sixtieth pass (which added ``processLogTail`` helper + Process Monitor
``EvalCheckpointLiveCard`` eval parity). Log tail rendering is now deduplicated
into a shared ``ProcessLogTail`` component used across Data Generation, eval live
cards, and Process Monitor embedded sections.

**React frontend**
- ``ProcessLogTail`` — shared stdout/stderr tail display with ``compact`` and
  ``default`` variants for launcher live panels (§G.11 / §G.12 / §G.15 / §D.7)
- ``EvalCheckpointLiveCard`` — deduplicated inline log tail markup; import shared

Hundred-sixtieth pass closes the Process Monitor eval live panel gap left after the
hundred-fifty-ninth pass (which added ``EvalCheckpointLiveCard`` on Evaluation Runner).
Process Monitor now shows the same per-checkpoint live row during running eval
processes, and log tail formatting is deduplicated into a shared helper.

**React frontend**
- ``processLogTail`` — shared stdout/stderr tail helper for live eval panels (§G.12 /
  §G.15 / §D.7)
- Process Monitor — selected ``eval`` processes use ``EvalCheckpointLiveCard`` during
  live runs and while waiting for structured JSON; ``EvalResultCard`` retained on
  completion with metrics + ``Open in Analytics →`` (§G.12 / §G.15 / §D.7)
- Evaluation Runner — deduplicated inline log tail formatting; import shared

Hundred-fifty-ninth pass closes the monitor-page footer gap left after the
hundred-fifty-eighth pass (which added ``ProcessIdFooter`` on launcher pages and
Training Hub). All train/HPO monitor pages and Process Monitor embedded sections
now show a shared process-id footer row, and Evaluation Runner per-checkpoint
live rows are deduplicated into a shared card component.

**React frontend**
- ``ProcessIdFooter`` — monitor-page footer parity across Training Monitor, HPO
  Tracker, Experiment Tracker, and Process Monitor embedded sections; process id
  removed from inline headers (§G.15 / §G.17 / §G.18 / §D.7)
- Training Monitor + HPO Tracker + Experiment Tracker — ``TrainHpoLivePanel``
  ``footer`` process-id row parity with Training Hub (§G.10 / §G.17 / §G.18 / §D.7)
- Process Monitor — ``LauncherLivePanel`` + ``TrainHpoLivePanel`` embedded

Hundred-fifty-third pass closes the header badge parity gap left after the
hundred-fifty-second pass (which aligned post-run banner counts and metric-label
styling). All train/HPO workflow pages now share ``TrainHpoRehydrationBadges``
so live panel headers surface health alerts and attention snapshots alongside
metric updates when rehydrated from ``useProcessStore``.

**React frontend**
- ``TrainHpoRehydrationBadges`` — shared metric / health / attention count badges
  for train/HPO live panel headers (§G.10 / §G.15 / §G.17 / §G.18 / §A.2 / §A.4 / §D.7)

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — hundred-fifty-second pass (§G.10 + §G.17 + §A.2 + §A.4 + §D.7)

Hundred-fifty-second pass closes the post-run banner and metric-label parity gap left after the
hundred-fifty-first pass (which deduplicated ``TrainHpoAnalyticsStrip`` across train/HPO workflow
pages). Training Monitor now feeds rehydrated health and attention entries into the shared strip
for accurate ``postRunTrainingRehydrationMessage`` counts while keeping page-level panels
separate, and both Training Hub and Training Monitor align ``metric updates`` label styling and
visibility with Process Monitor / HPO Tracker / Experiment Tracker.

**React frontend**
- Training Monitor — ``TrainHpoAnalyticsStrip`` receives ``effectiveLiveHealth`` +
  ``effectiveLiveAttention`` for post-run banner counts; ``showHealthAttention={false}`` preserves
  page-level ``TrainingHealthPanel`` / ``RuntimeAttentionPanel`` (§G.17 / §A.2 / §A.4 / §D.7)

#### Analysis script & report — Pareto-front policy catalogue

- `logic/gen/gen_simulation_analysis.py` — new `build_pareto_front_table(df)` function:
  - Computes the Pareto front (min overflows, max kg/km) independently for each `(dist, improver)` panel
  - Groups front members by unique `(selection variant, constructor, improver)` key; merges `cf`/`sl_var` into a human-readable label (`LM (CF70)`, `SL (SL1)`, …)
  - Outputs a markdown table with columns: Selection | Constructor | Improver | Overflows | kg/km | Pareto-Front Scenarios
  - Scenarios column lists every `Region-N / Distribution` combination where that configuration reached the front; sorted descending by scenario count
  - Wired into `generate_markdown` at the end of section 2 (Analytics Comparison — Pareto View)
- `public/simulation_analysis.md` — "Pareto-Front Policy Catalogue" table inserted at the end of §2 (22 rows; BPC + ACO_HH + PG-CLNS dominate the front across all panels)

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — twelfth pass

  - `LIVE_KEY = "__live__"` constant: virtual run key for the live process entry in `metricsMap`
  - `normalizeMetricRow(raw)`: maps Lightning CSV column aliases to canonical `TrainingMetricsRow` keys — `train/rl_loss` / `train/il_loss` → `train_loss`; `val/cost` / `val_cost` → `val_loss`; `lr-*` prefix variants → `lr`; applied at both CSV load time and live stdout parse time
  - `parseMetricLine(line)` extended with `/`-containing key patterns (`\w[\w/]*`) to handle Lightning's `/`-separated metric names in key=value format
  - `METRIC_SIGNAL_KEYS` extended with Lightning variants: `train/rl_loss`, `train/il_loss`, `val/cost`, `val_cost`
  - `activeTrainId`: `useMemo` over `useProcessStore` — first `train_*` process with `status === "running"`
  - Live stdout `useEffect`: when `activeTrainId` is set, initializes `metricsMap[LIVE_KEY] = []` and attaches a `process:stdout` listener that calls `parseMetricLine` and appends parsed rows; cleans up on `activeTrainId` change
  - Auto-select `useEffect`: prepends `LIVE_KEY` to `selected` when `activeTrainId` appears; removes it when process exits
  - `runsMetrics` memo: live entry inserted first with `name: "Live Training"`
  - Live entry in run selector: `Radio` icon with `animate-pulse`; update count shown; checkbox to toggle manually
  - Live `RunPanel`-style block: green pulsing dot header + `GradNormSparkline` + `LrSparkline` for the live row set
  - CSV loading now applies `normalizeMetricRow` via `rows.map(normalizeMetricRow)` in `loadMetrics`
- `pages/launch/TrainingHub.tsx` — column normalization sync:

- `pages/launch/SimulationLauncher.tsx` — session persistence (§G.9) + auto-navigate (§G.9):
  - Local `useState` for all form fields replaced with `useSimLauncherStore`
  - `navCountdown: number | null` state; first `useEffect` sets it to 5 when `simStatus === "completed"`; second `useEffect` decrements every second via `setTimeout` and calls `setMode("simulation_summary")` on 0
  - Countdown label `"(auto in Xs — cancel)"` shown beside "View Summary →" button; cancel clears countdown
- `pages/launch/TrainingHub.tsx` — session persistence (§G.10) + sparklines (§G.10):
  - Local `useState` for all form fields replaced with `useTrainHubStore`
  - `MiniSparkline` component: compact 70 px ECharts `line` chart; area fill at `color + "22"` opacity; returns `null` when all data values are null (metric not emitted by the run)
  - Grad norm sparkline (red `#f87171`) + entropy sparkline (purple `#a78bfa`) rendered as a 2-column grid below `LiveChart` when ≥2 metric updates have been received
- `pages/launch/DataGeneration.tsx` — session persistence (§G.11):
  - Local `useState` for all form fields replaced with `useDataGenStore`
  - `toggleDist` rewritten to avoid functional updater (incompatible with store `patch` signature)

  - Progress bar rendered in `ProcessRow` between header row and log viewer when process is running and progress data is present; deterministic `width: pct%` bar when `total` is known, indeterminate pulsing bar otherwise
- `pages/monitor/SimulationMonitor.tsx` — policy multi-select overlay (§G.16):
  - `POLICY_COLORS` 8-colour palette (`#6366f1`, `#34d399`, `#f87171`, …) defined at module level
  - `MetricTimeseries` refactored: replaces `entries` + implicit single series with `policySeries: { policy; entries; color }[]`; builds one ECharts line series per policy; shows legend when >1 series; top grid margin increases to 20 when legend is visible; area fill only when single series
  - `chartPolicies: string[]` state + `activeChartPolicies` memo (defaults to all policies when `chartPolicies` is empty)
  - `toggleChartPolicy(p)` callback: XOR toggle; prevents deselecting all (resets to full set)
  - `policySeries` memo: maps each `activeChartPolicy` to filtered entries + assigned color
  - Chip-toggle row rendered below header controls when ≥2 policies present; chip border/text/background tinted with policy color; inactive chips at 35% opacity

**ROADMAP**
- §G.15 progress bar checked; cancel button confirmed already wired (no code change); toast notifications checked

- `store/app.ts` — `pendingLogPath: string | null` + `setPendingLogPath` action (ephemeral, not persisted)
- `App.tsx` — global keyboard shortcuts (§G.7):
  - `Ctrl+,` → `settings`; `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `process_monitor`
  - Digit `1`–`8` (when no input focused): quick-switch to simulation / simulation_summary / training / benchmark / sim_launcher / training_hub / process_monitor / settings

**Project structure**
- `app/src/pages/` reorganised into five subdirectories mirroring sidebar sections:
  - `monitor/` — SimulationMonitor, TrainingMonitor, ProcessMonitor
  - `analysis/` — SimulationSummary, BenchmarkAnalysis, DataExplorer, ExperimentTracker, AlgorithmComparison, HPOTracker
  - `launch/` — SimulationLauncher, TrainingHub, DataGeneration, EvaluationRunner
  - `files/` — ConfigEditor, OutputBrowser
  - `app/` — Settings
- All intra-page imports updated from `../` to `../../`; `App.tsx` import paths updated to `pages/<subdir>/`

#### ROADMAP

- `docs/moon/ROADMAP.md` — §G.10 live training progress checked; §G.14 metadata panel and Open in Sim Summary checked; §G.19 import/export checked

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — sixth pass

Sixth implementation pass: SimulationLauncher gains a live-status panel (§G.9); ConfigEditor gains a
Save button (§G.13); ProcessMonitor gains structured JSON log rendering and persistent history (§G.15);
SimulationSummary is rewritten with a ranking table, per-day trajectory chart, and four metric charts.

**Rust backend**
- `commands/data.rs` — `write_text_file(path, content)`: writes (or overwrites) any text file; creates parent directories; used by ConfigEditor Save button; registered in `lib.rs`

**React frontend**
- `pages/SimulationLauncher.tsx` — live-status panel (§G.9):
  - After launch, subscribes to `process:stdout` Tauri events filtered by the spawned process ID
  - Parses `GUI_DAY_LOG_START:` markers (same protocol as `sim_watcher.rs`) to extract `DayLogEntry` JSON
  - Displays a per-policy card grid with latest day / profit / km / overflows in real time
  - Status header: animated `Activity` icon while running; `CheckCircle`/`XCircle` on completion
  - "View Summary →" button navigates to `simulation_summary` mode; "Process Monitor" button to `process_monitor`
- `pages/ConfigEditor.tsx` — Save button (§G.13):
  - Calls `write_text_file` Tauri command with the currently open path and textarea content
  - Tracks dirty state via `savedContentRef` (updates on open + save); button label shows `Save*` when unsaved edits exist; disabled when no changes
  - `Save` icon from lucide-react; spinner shown during write
- `pages/SimulationSummary.tsx` — full rewrite:
  - `RankingTable` component: sortable by any of 4 metrics (profit / km / overflows / kg); click column header to sort ascending/descending; shows mean ± std in `font-mono`; coloured policy dot + rank number
  - `TrajectoryChart` component: single ECharts line chart overlaying all policies across simulation days (mean per day, averaged across samples); metric selector tabs (Overflows / Profit / Distance / Waste); 8-colour palette
  - `MetricBarChart` component: per-metric bar chart with std dev exposed in tooltip hover
  - `aggregateByPolicyAndDay` helper for trajectory data: groups entries by `(policy, day)`, averages across samples
  - `std()` helper function
- `pages/ProcessMonitor.tsx` — improvements (§G.15):
  - `LogLine` component: attempts `JSON.parse` on each log line; if the result has `level`/`levelname`/`severity` and `msg`/`message`/`text` fields, renders timestamp prefix + colour-coded level badge (danger/warning/muted/default) + message body; falls back to raw string otherwise
  - Per-row `Trash2` "Remove" button for completed processes
  - "Clear completed (N)" header button calls `clearCompleted` store action
- `store/process.ts` — persistence and bulk-clear (§G.15):
  - Wrapped `create` in `persist` middleware; `partialize` strips `logLines` and retains only the last 50 non-running processes; stored under key `"wsmart-studio-processes"`
  - `clearCompleted()` action: removes all entries with `status !== "running"` from the map

#### ROADMAP

- `docs/moon/ROADMAP.md` — §G.9 live-status item checked; §G.13 `write_text_file` and Save button checked; §G.15 structured log parsing, remove/clear buttons, and history persistence checked; §G.16 Simulation Summary rewrite noted

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — fifth pass

Fifth implementation pass: SimulationMonitor gains day-scrubber controls, a bin-fill strip chart,
and a tour sequence table (§G.16); TrainingMonitor gains multi-run overlay chart, hyperparameter
panel, gradient norm sparkline, and checkpoint browser with one-click Eval Runner handoff (§G.17).

**React frontend**
- `pages/SimulationMonitor.tsx` — rewritten:
  - Day scrubber: `◀`/`▶` step buttons flanking the range input; "Following" badge (green pulse, shown when `selectedDay` is null and watcher active); "Latest ↓" button releases back to auto-follow
  - `BinFillStrip` component: top-25 bins sorted by fill %, 0-100% horizontal bars (green <80%, amber ≥80%, red ≥100%), mandatory (!) and collected (✓) badges; show/hide toggle
  - `TourTable` component: stop #, bin ID, fill %, collected, mandatory columns; reads `tour_indices` preferentially; capped at 60 rows; show/hide toggle
- `pages/TrainingMonitor.tsx` — rewritten:
  - `MultiRunChart`: single ECharts canvas overlaying all selected runs; 8-colour palette; solid train loss, dashed val loss, dotted reward (right y-axis); scrollable legend
  - `GradNormSparkline`: compact `grad_norm` chart per run
  - `HparamsPanel`: collapsible; reads `hparams.yaml` via `read_text_file`; flat YAML parser; 8-row preview with "Show all" expand
  - `CheckpointBrowser`: `list_dir` on `<run>/checkpoints/`; "Load in Eval Runner →" button sets `pendingCheckpoint` in app store and navigates to Eval Runner
  - `RunPanel`: groups grad norm + hparams + checkpoints per run below the shared overlay chart
- `pages/EvaluationRunner.tsx` — reads `pendingCheckpoint` on mount via `useEffect`; pre-populates first checkpoint entry and clears the store field
- `store/app.ts` — `pendingCheckpoint: string | null` + `setPendingCheckpoint` action (not persisted)

#### Build tooling

- `tools/app/justfile` — added `bundle` (list installer output), `logs-dir` (print platform data dir), `reset-data` (delete Tauri Store files)
- Root `justfile` — added `studio-reset` shorthand (→ `app::reset-data`)

#### ROADMAP

- `docs/moon/ROADMAP.md` — §G.16 items checked (bin-fill, tour table, day scrubber, secondary KPI toggle); §G.17 items checked (multi-run overlay, grad norm, hparams panel, checkpoint browser)

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — fourth pass

Fourth implementation pass: Evaluation Runner page (§G.12), full DataGeneration form (§G.11),
Settings validation with Rust backend probes, `tools/app/justfile` Clippy/outdated recipes,
and `studio-check`/`studio-clippy` root shorthands.

**Rust backend**
- `commands/system.rs` — new module with two commands:
  - `validate_project_root(path)`: checks path exists, is a directory, and contains `main.py`
  - `probe_python(python_path)`: runs `<path> --version`, handles Python 2 (stderr) and 3 (stdout), returns version string
- `lib.rs` — registers `validate_project_root` and `probe_python`; imports `system` module

**React frontend**
- `pages/EvaluationRunner.tsx` — new: dynamic checkpoint list (add/remove/file-picker), dataset path picker, problem/strategy/device/val_size selects, multi-checkpoint launch (one process per checkpoint, tagged by filename), Advanced Overrides, command preview, results placeholder (§G.12)
- `pages/DataGeneration.tsx` — rewritten: problem selector, distribution checkboxes (Gamma-3/Empirical), dataset type selector, overwrite toggle, graph form (area/num_loc/n_samples/n_days), Advanced Overrides, command preview; Hydra args mirror `gen_data.yaml` (§G.11)
- `pages/Settings.tsx` — validation wiring: `onBlur` and pre-save calls to `validate_project_root` and `probe_python`; inline `CheckCircle`/`XCircle` badges; save blocked on validation errors
- `types/index.ts` — `"eval_runner"` added to `AppMode` union
- `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` — `"Evaluation Runner"` entry added to Launch section; `ClipboardList` icon
- `components/layout/TopBar.tsx` — `"Evaluation Runner"` title added to TITLES map
- `App.tsx` — `EvaluationRunner` import and router case added

#### Build tooling

- `tools/app/justfile` — added `clippy` (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`) and `outdated` (`npm outdated`) recipes
- Root `justfile` — added `studio-check` (→ `app::check`) and `studio-clippy` (→ `app::clippy`) shorthands

#### ROADMAP

- `docs/moon/ROADMAP.md` — §G.11 additional items checked (full form); §G.12 marked 🚧 In Progress with completed items; §G.19 additional items checked (validation commands)

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — third pass

Third implementation pass: full-featured Simulation Launcher and Training Hub forms, tabular
Process Monitor with live duration, Settings page (§G.19) with project root / Python path
persistence, first-run onboarding banner, and extended `tools/app/justfile`.

**Rust backend**
- `process::spawn_python_process`: new `python_executable: Option<String>` parameter; empty string treated as `None`, falling back to `which_python`
- `process::which_python`: now takes `working_dir` parameter; checks `<workingDir>/.venv/bin/python` (uv-managed venv) and `<workingDir>/.venv/Scripts/python.exe` (Windows) before system PATH

**React frontend**
- `pages/SimulationLauncher.tsx` — rewritten: 8-policy multi-select checkboxes; area / num_loc / n_samples / cpu_cores / seed inputs; distribution radio (Normal/Gamma/Empirical); Advanced Overrides collapsible; `useMemo` command preview; Hydra args exactly mirror `just controller::test-sim`
- `pages/TrainingHub.tsx` — rewritten: mode selector (Train / HPO Sweep / Evaluate); problem/model/encoder selects; mode-specific param groups (epochs/batch_size for train; method/trials/workers for HPO; checkpoint picker / dataset picker / strategy / val_size for eval); WandB toggle; command preview
- `pages/ProcessMonitor.tsx` — rewritten: tabular `ProcessRow` components with `StatusPill`, process ID, command, PID, live duration (`useLiveDuration` 1s tick), exit code; expand/collapse inline log with auto-scroll toggle; stderr lines coloured warning
- `pages/Settings.tsx` — new: Project Root (text input + directory picker), Python Executable (override `which_python`), Appearance (dark/light radio), About section; dirty-state detection; Save / Discard buttons
- `store/app.ts` — `pythonPath` field + `setPythonPath` action added; persisted via `partialize`
- `types/index.ts` — `"settings"` added to `AppMode` union
- `hooks/useSpawnProcess.ts` — reads `pythonPath` from app store; passes `pythonExecutable: pythonPath || null` to `spawn_python_process`
- `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` — "App" section added with Settings entry; `FolderOpen` icon for output_browser; `Settings` icon for settings entry
- `components/layout/TopBar.tsx` — first-run warning banner: shown when `projectRoot` is empty and mode ≠ `"settings"`; "Open Settings" quick-link
- `App.tsx` — Settings page import and router case added

#### Build tooling

- `tools/app/justfile` — extended with `check-rust` (`cargo check`), `fmt-rust` (`cargo fmt`), `preview` (build + serve), `update` (`npm update`) recipes

#### ROADMAP

- `docs/moon/ROADMAP.md` — §G.9 additional items checked (full form); §G.10 additional items checked (full form, all three modes); §G.15 additional items checked (tabular layout, live duration); §G.19 added (Settings & First-Run Onboarding); Effort × Impact matrix updated

---

#### WSmart-Route Studio — Tauri App (`app/`) — second pass

Second implementation pass: completes all page stubs, wires process lifecycle events, adds
Config Editor (§G.13) and Output Browser (§G.14), and introduces `tools/app/justfile`.

**Rust backend additions**
- `data::read_text_file` — reads any text file (YAML, JSON, plain text) as a `String`; used by ConfigEditor and OutputBrowser
- `data::list_dir` — lists files and subdirectories in a path; returns `DirEntry` with `name`, `path`, `is_dir`, `size_bytes`, `extension`
- `process::ProcessSpawned` event — emitted immediately when a process is spawned (before any stdout); frontend registers the process in the store automatically via `useProcessMonitor`
- `process::which_python` — now resolves `<workingDir>/.venv/bin/python` first (uv-managed project venv), then `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` (Windows), then system PATH

**React frontend additions**
- `hooks/useSpawnProcess.ts` — wraps `spawn_python_process` invoke with loading state and `sonner` toasts; used by all three launcher pages
- `hooks/useProcessMonitor.ts` — now subscribes to `process:spawn` (new) in addition to `process:stdout` and `process:status`; process is registered in the store on spawn, not on first stdout line
- `pages/ConfigEditor.tsx` — Raw / Table / Diff view modes for any YAML/TOML config file; flat YAML parser; "Copy Overrides" button via `navigator.clipboard`; Diff view highlights changed keys between two files (e.g. `pruned_config.yaml` from two runs)
- `pages/OutputBrowser.tsx` — three-pane layout: run list (`list_output_dirs`), file tree (`list_dir`, lazy-loads subdirs), file viewer (CSV table up to 200 rows; raw text for YAML/JSON/log); arbitrary directory picker via Tauri dialog
- `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` — added "Files" section with Output Browser and Config Editor entries
- `types/index.ts` — added `ProcessSpawned`, `DirEntry`, `OutputDir` interfaces
- Updated `SimulationLauncher`, `TrainingHub`, `DataGeneration` to use `useSpawnProcess` (removes direct `invoke` calls and manual state management)

#### Build tooling

- `tools/app/justfile` — new just module with `install`, `dev`, `tauri-dev`, `build`, `check`, `clean-js`, `clean-rust`, `clean` recipes
- Root `justfile` — added `mod app 'tools/app'` and shorthands: `just studio` (→ `app::tauri-dev`), `just studio-build` (→ `app::build`), `just studio-install` (→ `app::install`)
- `tools/helper/justfile` — updated help text to list `app` module and `just studio` shorthand

#### ROADMAP

- `docs/moon/ROADMAP.md` — marked §G.0, §G.9–§G.15 as 🚧 In Progress with completed items checked; remaining items clearly separated

---
