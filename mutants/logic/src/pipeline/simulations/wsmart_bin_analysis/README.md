# WSmart+ Bin Analysis
This git is very disorganized, but I hope I will have time to organize it before the schoolarship ends.

## R
Most scripts are exploratory. To make comparisons, access predictor_comparison.R; the prediction methods that are ready for testing are in the files with the same name; the rest is exploratory.

## PYTHON

Packages versions:
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/): 1.26
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): 2.2.2
- [Python](https://www.python.org/): 3.12
- [Matplotlib] :3.9.2
- [Scipy] :1.14.1


### Execution examples
Check the tutorials folder. There are ones that have not commnets, those have been run in order tutorials, but the code is there if you want to run it to that specific example.


### If installing R in WSL
sudo apt-get install gcc
sudo apt-get install gfortran
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
