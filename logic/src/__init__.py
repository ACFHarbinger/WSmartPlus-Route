"""
The Logic Layer of the WSmart+ Route framework.

This package contains the core intelligence and simulation logic, organized into:
- models/: Neural network architectures (AM, GATLSTManager, etc.)
- subnets/: Encoders, decoders, and predictors.
- modules/: Atomic neural components (Attention, Normalization).
- problems/: Physics of the routing environments (VRPP, WCVRP, SCWCVRP).
- policies/: Classical heuristics and OR solvers.
- pipeline/: Training, evaluation, and simulation orchestration.
