"""
NDS-BRKGA Configuration for Hydra.

This dataclass mirrors :class:`~logic.src.policies.selection_and_construction.non_dominated_sorting_biased_random_key_genetic_algorithm.params.NDSBRKGAParams`
with Hydra-compatible field types.  It is referenced by the Hydra config
system when ``policy=nds_brkga`` is specified on the command line.

Usage::

    python main.py test_sim \\
        --policies nds_brkga \\
        policy.nds_brkga.pop_size=80 \\
        policy.nds_brkga.time_limit=120

Attributes:
    NDSBRKGAConfig: Configuration for the NDS-BRKGA policy.

Example:
    >>> from configs.policies.nds_brkga import NDSBRKGAConfig
    >>> config = NDSBRKGAConfig()
    >>> config.pop_size
    60
    >>> config.max_generations
    200
    >>> config.time_limit
    90.0

class NDSBRKGAConfig:
    """
    Hydra configuration for the NDS-BRKGA joint selection-and-construction policy.

    Attributes:
        pop_size: Total population size per generation.
        n_elite: Number of elite chromosomes preserved via NSGA-II each generation.
        n_mutants: Number of random mutant chromosomes injected each generation.
        bias_elite: Probability of inheriting each gene from the elite parent
            during biased uniform crossover.
        max_generations: Maximum number of evolutionary generations.
        time_limit: Wall-clock time limit in seconds.
        seed: Random seed for reproducibility.
        vrpp: If ``True``, optional bins can be included for additional profit.
        overflow_penalty: Weight applied to the overflow-cost objective.
        seed_selection_strategy: Name of the mandatory-selection strategy used
            to generate seeded initial chromosomes.
        seed_routing_strategy: Name of the routing operator used to build the
            routing component of seed chromosomes (``"greedy"`` uses the
            built-in nearest-neighbour heuristic).
        n_seed_solutions: Number of seed solutions per sub-problem strategy.
        selection_threshold_min: Threshold for max-risk bins (almost always selected).
        selection_threshold_max: Threshold for zero-risk bins (rarely selected).
        mandatory_selection: Unused placeholder for Hydra config composition
            compatibility.
        route_improvement: Unused placeholder for Hydra config composition
            compatibility.
