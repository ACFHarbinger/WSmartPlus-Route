    Configuration for the Constraint Programming (CP-SAT) policy.

    Attributes:
        num_days: Multi-day horizon.
        time_limit: Maximum solve time in seconds.
        search_workers: Number of parallel workers for CP-SAT.
        mip_gap: Relative gap for optimality (conceptually similar in CP-SAT).
        scaling_factor: Precision factor for integer conversion (default 1000).
        waste_weight: Weight for waste collected in the objective.
        cost_weight: Weight for travel cost in the objective.
        overflow_penalty: Penalty per unit of overflow.
        mean_increment: Expected daily waste increment for bins.
        seed: Random seed for reproducibility.
        mandatory_selection: Node selection strategy configuration.
