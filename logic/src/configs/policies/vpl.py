    Configuration for the Volleyball Premier League policy.

    VPL maintains a dual population structure with active and passive teams.
    The algorithm features four main phases: Team Formation, Competition,
    Substitution, and Coaching & Learning.

    Attributes:
        n_teams: Number of active teams (total = 2 * n_teams).
        max_iterations: Maximum number of iterations to run the search.
        substitution_rate: Diversity injection rate from passive teams.
        coaching_weight_1: Learning weight for the best team.
        coaching_weight_2: Learning weight for the 2nd best team.
        coaching_weight_3: Learning weight for the 3rd best team.
        elite_size: Number of elite teams to preserve.
        local_search_iterations: Number of iterations to run local search at each neighborhood level.
        time_limit: Maximum time in seconds to run the search.
        seed: Random seed for reproducibility.
        vrpp: Whether the problem is a Vehicle Routing Problem with Profits.
        mandatory_selection: List of mandatory node selection strategies to apply.
        route_improvement: List of route improvement strategies to apply.
