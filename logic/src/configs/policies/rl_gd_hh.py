"""
RL-GD-HH (Reinforcement Learning Great Deluge Hyper-Heuristic) configuration for Hydra.

This module defines the schema and default values for the RL-GD-HH policy,
aligned directly with the Ozcan et al. (2010) paper specification.

Paper mappings (Section 3, Table 1):
    - maxUtilityValue = utility_upper_bound = 40
    - Initial utility  = 0.75 × 40 = 30
    - qualityLB        = quality_lb = 0
    - Reward           = +1 (additive, RL1)
    - Penalty          = −1 (RL1), ÷2 (RL2), √ (RL3)
