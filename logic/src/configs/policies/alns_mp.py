@dataclass
class ALNSMPConfig:
    """Configuration for the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search with Inter-Period Operators.

    Extends the standard ALNS with horizon-spanning destroy/repair operators that
    reason across the full T-day chromosome, enabling coordinated multi-day scheduling.

    Attributes:
        time_limit: Maximum runtime in seconds per solve call.
        max_iterations: Maximum ALNS iterations per solve call.
        start_temp: Initial temperature (0 = dynamic).
        cooling_rate: SA temperature decay per iteration.
        reaction_factor: Operator weight learning rate.
        min_removal: Minimum nodes to remove per destroy step.
        max_removal_pct: Maximum percentage of nodes to remove.
        max_removal_cap: Hard upper cap on removal count.
        segment_size: Iterations per operator-weight update segment.
        noise_factor: Noise level for repair operators.
        worst_removal_randomness: Randomness in worst removal (p ≥ 1).
        shaw_randomization: Shaw removal randomisation factor.
        regret_pool: Regret operator pool size ("regret2", "regret234", "regretAll").
        sigma_1: Score for new global best solution.
        sigma_2: Score for improving (but not best) solution.
        sigma_3: Score for accepted worse solution.
        vrpp: If True, allow inserting nodes not in the removed pool.
        profit_aware_operators: Use profit-aware operator variants.
        extended_operators: Add string/cluster/neighbor operators.
        seed: Random seed for reproducibility.
        engine: Engine backend ("custom").
        horizon: Planning horizon T (number of days).
        stockout_penalty: Penalty per unit of bin overflow.
        forward_looking_depth: Lookahead days H for insertion evaluation.
        inter_period_operators: Enable inter-period destroy operators.
        shift_direction: Direction of ShiftVisitRemoval ("both", "forward", "backward").
        inventory_lambda: Weight on inventory term in forward-looking insertion.
        inter_period_weight: Initial weight for inter-period operators.
