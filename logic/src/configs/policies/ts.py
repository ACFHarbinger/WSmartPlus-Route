    """Configuration for the Tabu Search policy.

    Attributes:
        tabu_tenure: Tenure for the short-term memory (number of iterations to keep moves tabu).
        dynamic_tenure: Whether to dynamically adjust tabu tenure during search.
        min_tenure: Minimum tabu tenure value when dynamic tenure is enabled.
        max_tenure: Maximum tabu tenure value when dynamic tenure is enabled.
        aspiration_enabled: Whether to allow moves that violate tabu status if they improve the solution.
        intensification_enabled: Whether to use intensification (focusing on high-performing regions).
        diversification_enabled: Whether to use diversification (exploring new regions).
        intensification_interval: Number of iterations between intensification phases.
        diversification_interval: Number of iterations between diversification phases.
        elite_size: Number of elite solutions to maintain for intensification.
        frequency_penalty_weight: Weight for frequency-based penalties in long-term memory.
        candidate_list_enabled: Whether to use candidate lists to limit neighborhood exploration.
        candidate_list_size: Maximum number of candidates to consider from the neighborhood.
        oscillation_enabled: Whether to use strategic oscillation to escape local optima.
        feasibility_tolerance: Tolerance for infeasibility when using strategic oscillation.
        max_iterations: Maximum number of iterations to run the search.
        max_iterations_no_improve: Maximum number of iterations without improvement before stopping.
        n_removal: Number of routes/sequences to remove in each iteration (for destroying and rebuilding).
        n_llh: Number of local search operators to apply in each iteration.
        time_limit: Maximum time in seconds to run the search.
        use_swap: Whether to include swap moves in the neighborhood.
        use_relocate: Whether to include relocate moves in the neighborhood.
        use_2opt: Whether to include 2-opt moves in the neighborhood.
        use_insertion: Whether to include insertion moves in the neighborhood.
        seed: Random seed for reproducibility.
        vrpp: Whether the problem is a Vehicle Routing Problem with Profits.
        profit_aware_operators: Whether to use profit-aware considerations in neighborhood operators.
        mandatory_selection: List of mandatory node selection strategies to apply.
        route_improvement: List of route improvement strategies to apply.
        acceptance_criterion: Configuration for the acceptance criterion (e.g., simulated annealing).
