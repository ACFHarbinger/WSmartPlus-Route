"""Policy Visualization Mixin.

Provides lightweight, zero-overhead state recording for classical and
heuristic policies. Import :class:`PolicyVizMixin` and add it as a
mixin base-class to any policy that should expose iteration data to the
Streamlit dashboard.

Attributes:
    PolicyStateRecorder: Fixed-capacity ring-buffer for per-iteration policy telemetry.
    PolicyVizMixin: Mixin that adds zero-overhead telemetry to policy classes.

Example:
    >>> class VectorizedALNS(PolicyVizMixin):
    ...     def solve(self, *args, **kwargs):
    ...         for i in range(10):
    ...             self._viz_record(iteration=i, best_cost=100.0 - i)
    >>> solver = VectorizedALNS()
    >>> solver.solve()
    >>> data = solver.get_viz_data()
    >>> data["iteration"]
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
