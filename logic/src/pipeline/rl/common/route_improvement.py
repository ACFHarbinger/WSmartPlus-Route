"""
Route improvement utilities.
Includes route decoding, efficiency calculation, and lightweight optimization.

Attributes:
    EfficiencyOptimizer: Optimizes routes as a route improvement step.
    decode_routes: Converts action sequences to clean route lists on CPU.
    calculate_efficiency: Computes kg/km efficiency metric.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.pipeline.rl.common.route_improvement import EfficiencyOptimizer, decode_routes, calculate_efficiency
    >>> optimizer = EfficiencyOptimizer(problem)
    >>> routes = optimizer.optimize(actions, num_nodes)
    >>> efficiency = calculate_efficiency(routes, dist_matrix, waste, capacity)
    >>> print(efficiency)
