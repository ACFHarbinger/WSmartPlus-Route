"""
Pipeline Module.

This package orchestrates the primary operational workflows of the WSmart-Route framework:
- **Training**: Core RL training logic and hyperparameter optimization (`train.py`).
- **Evaluation**: Model inference and performance benchmarking (`eval.py`).
- **Testing**: Large-scale simulation testing across various policies and scenarios (`test.py`).
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Specialized training loops and meta-learning strategies (`reinforcement_learning/`).
- **Simulator**: The underlying physics engine and environment management (`simulator/`).
