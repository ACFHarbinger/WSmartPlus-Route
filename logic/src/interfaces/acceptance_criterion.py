"""
IAcceptanceCriterion — Move Acceptance Interface.

Defines the contract for all pluggable move-acceptance strategies used
during route construction and improvement.  Every concrete implementation
MUST be stateless between ``accept()`` calls; internal state (temperature,
water level, etc.) is advanced only via ``step()``.

The ``accept()`` method now returns a ``Tuple[bool, AcceptanceMetrics]``
so that callers can thread per-step telemetry into the ``SearchContext``
without polling ``get_state()`` separately.  ``get_state()`` is retained for
backward compatibility but is superseded by the metrics in the returned tuple.
