IRouteConstructor — Route Construction Interface.

Defines the adapter contract for all routing policies (Neural, Classical,
Heuristic) that generate a tour from a mandatory bin list.  The third
element of the return tuple carries the ``SearchContext`` produced or
enriched during Phase 2 of the pipeline.
