IRouteImprovement — Route Improvement Interface.

Defines the contract for all route improvement / local-search operators.
Implementations MUST NOT hold mutable state that accumulates between
``process()`` calls; all intermediate variables belong in the returned
``ImprovementMetrics`` dict.

Attributes:
    IRouteImprovement: Interface for all routing route improvers
    ImprovementMetrics: Metrics for route improvement

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.interfaces.route_improvement import IRouteImprovement
    >>> from logic.src.interfaces.context.search_context import ImprovementMetrics

    Interface for all routing route improvers.

    All concrete implementations must:

    1. Not store algorithm state as instance attributes that mutate during
       ``process()``.  Configuration (time limits, seeds, etc.) may be
       stored at construction time.
    2. Return a ``Tuple[List[int], ImprovementMetrics]`` from ``process()``.
       The ``ImprovementMetrics`` dict is the mechanism for exporting
       telemetry to the ``SearchContext`` without coupling to it directly.
