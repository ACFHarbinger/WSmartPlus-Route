"""Selection strategies package.

This package provides vectorized bin selection strategies for identifying
mandatory nodes across a batch of environments. It includes reactive,
periodic, predictive, and neural network-based heuristics.

Attributes:
    VectorizedSelector: Abstract base class for all selectors.
    LastMinuteSelector: Threshold-based reactive selection.
    RegularSelector: Periodic collection on scheduled days.
    LookaheadSelector: Predictive overflow-based selection.
    RevenueSelector: Revenue-based selection.
    ServiceLevelSelector: Statistical overflow prediction.
    CombinedSelector: Logic-based combination of multiple strategies.
    ManagerSelector: Neural network-based selection (MandatoryManager).
    get_vectorized_selector: Factory function for easy instantiation by name.
    create_selector_from_config: Factory for configuration-driven instantiation.
