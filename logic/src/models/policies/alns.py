"""ALNS Policy wrapper for RL4CO integration.

This module provides the `VectorizedALNS` class, which wraps the high-performance
ALNS engine to satisfy the `AutoregressivePolicy` interface used in training
and evaluation pipelines.

Attributes:
    VectorizedALNS: ALNS solver wrapper for the RL4CO pipeline.

Example:
    >>> policy = VectorizedALNS(env_name="wcvrp")
    >>> out = policy(td)
