"""Exchange operators package.

This package provides vectorized inter-route exchange operators, including
the complex ejection chain heuristic and the generalized lambda-interchange
family of moves.

Attributes:
    vectorized_cross_exchange: Inter-route segment exchange.
    vectorized_ejection_chain: Multi-route node redistribution for fleet minimization.
    vectorized_lambda_interchange: Generalized segment exchange search (0..λ).
    vectorized_or_opt: Segment relocation within or between routes.
