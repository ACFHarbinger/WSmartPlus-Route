    """
    Vectorized ejection chain operator for fleet minimization using PyTorch.

    Ejection chain is a sophisticated operator that attempts to eliminate routes
    by ejecting all their customers into other routes. When direct insertion is
    not possible due to capacity constraints, it triggers a chain of displacements:
    - Eject a customer from the target route
    - Insert the new customer in its place
    - Recursively find a place for the ejected customer

    This creates a chain of ejections that can span multiple routes, making it
    possible to consolidate routes that couldn't be merged otherwise.

    Algorithm (per batch instance):
    1. Identify routes to empty (smallest/least utilized first)
    2. For each customer in target route:
        a. Try direct insertion into other routes
        b. If no capacity, try ejection chain:
            - Select a route to receive customer
            - Eject a customer from that route to make space
            - Recursively insert ejected customer (depth-limited)
        c. Track all moves for potential rollback
    3. If all customers successfully placed, route is eliminated
    4. Otherwise, rollback all moves and try next route

    Args:
        tours: Batch of tours [B, N] where B=batch size, N=tour length
            Note: Tours should use depot (0) as route separator
        distance_matrix: Pairwise distances [B, N+1, N+1] or [N+1, N+1] (shared)
        capacities: Vehicle capacities [B] or scalar (optional, for capacity checks)
        demands: Node demands [B, N+1] or [N+1] (required for ejection chain)
        max_depth: Maximum recursion depth for ejection chain (default: 5)
            Higher values find more solutions but slower
        target_route_reduction: Number of routes to try eliminating (default: None = all)

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Modified tours [B, N] with potentially fewer routes

    Note:
        - Tours must have multiple routes (depot separators) to be effective
        - Requires demands tensor for capacity checking
        - This is a fleet minimization operator, not a cost minimization operator
        - Complexity: O(N² × max_depth) per route elimination attempt
        - Success rate depends on load distribution across routes
        - Routes with lowest utilization are targeted first

    Algorithm Details:
        The ejection chain uses depth-limited search with backtracking:
        1. Build ejection tree with candidate moves
        2. Evaluate feasibility at each node (capacity check)
        3. Backtrack when dead-end reached
        4. Accept solution when all nodes placed

    Example:
        >>> tours = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 0]])  # Two routes
        >>> dist = torch.rand(5, 5)
        >>> demands = torch.tensor([0, 1, 1, 1, 1])
        >>> capacities = torch.tensor([3.0])
        >>> improved = vectorized_ejection_chain(tours, dist, capacities, demands)
        # May consolidate into single route: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0]
