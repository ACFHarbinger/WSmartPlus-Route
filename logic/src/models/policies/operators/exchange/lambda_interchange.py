    """
    Vectorized λ-interchange local search across a batch of tours using PyTorch.

    λ-interchange systematically explores the cross-exchange neighborhood by trying
    all combinations of segment lengths from 0 to λ_max. This creates a rich
    neighborhood that includes:
    - λ=0: One-sided relocations (equivalent to relocate operator)
    - λ=1: Single node swaps and relocations
    - λ=2: Two-node segment exchanges
    - λ=k: k-node segment exchanges

    The operator iteratively applies cross-exchange with all segment length combinations
    until no improvement is found. This is more thorough than a single cross-exchange
    call but also more computationally expensive.

    Algorithm:
    1. For λ_a in [0, λ_max]:
        For λ_b in [0, λ_max]:
            Skip if both are 0 (no-op)
            Apply cross-exchange with segment lengths (λ_a, λ_b)
            If improvement found, restart from λ=0
    2. Repeat until no improvement found in full sweep

    Args:
        tours: Batch of tours [B, N] where B=batch size, N=tour length
        distance_matrix: Pairwise distances [B, N+1, N+1] or [N+1, N+1] (shared)
        capacities: Vehicle capacities [B] or scalar (optional, for capacity checks)
        demands: Node demands [B, N+1] or [N+1] (optional, for capacity checks)
        lambda_max: Maximum segment length to consider (default: 2)
            Higher values = larger neighborhood but slower
        max_iterations: Maximum number of full neighborhood sweeps (default: 50)

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Improved tours [B, N] with same shape as input

    Note:
        - Tours should include depot as node 0
        - For single-route problems, this operator has no effect
        - This is a wrapper around vectorized_cross_exchange
        - Complexity: O(λ_max² × N⁴) per sweep
        - More expensive than single cross-exchange but finds better solutions
        - Recommended λ_max values: 1-3 (2 is good balance)

    Example:
        >>> tours = torch.tensor([[0, 3, 1, 0, 2, 4, 0]])  # Two routes
        >>> dist = torch.rand(5, 5)  # Distance matrix
        >>> improved = vectorized_lambda_interchange(tours, dist, lambda_max=2)
