"""Random removal operator.

This module provides a GPU-accelerated implementation of the random removal
heuristic, which stochastically selects nodes to eject from tours, providing
diversification for large neighborhood search.

Attributes:
    vectorized_random_removal: Randomly removes nodes from tours.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.models.policies.operators.destroy.random_removal import vectorized_random_removal
    >>> tours, removed_nodes = vectorized_random_removal(tours, n_remove)
