"""Critic Network components for VRP.

This package provides estimators for state-value functions, and includes
both canonical (torch-based) and legacy (problem-based) implementations.

Attributes:
    CriticNetwork: Modern value function network.
    LegacyCriticNetwork: Backward-compatible critic implementation.
    create_critic_from_actor: Factory to initialize shared-backbone critics.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.models.common.critic_network import CriticNetwork
"""
