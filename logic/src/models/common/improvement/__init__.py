"""Improvement-based neural search components.

This package provides classes for improvement policies, which refine existing
solutions through iterative local search or optimization operators.

Attributes:
    ImprovementEncoder: Foundation for solution-aware state encoding.
    ImprovementDecoder: Foundation for predicting improvement moves.
    ImprovementPolicy: Standard iterative refinement policy implementation.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.models.common.improvement import ImprovementPolicy
