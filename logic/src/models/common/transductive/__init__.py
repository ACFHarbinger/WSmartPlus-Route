"""Transductive (Test-time Adaptation) components.

This package provides classes for transductive inference, where the model
parameters are adapted to specific test instances through optimization.

Attributes:
    TransductiveModel: Base foundation for all transductive methods.
    ActiveSearch: Full model parameter optimization at test-time.
    EAS: Efficient parameter adaptation using selective subsets.
    EASEmb: EAS variant targeting state embeddings.
    EASLay: EAS variant targeting architectural layers.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.models.common.transductive import ActiveSearch
