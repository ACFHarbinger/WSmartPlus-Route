"""Autoregressive neural routing components.

This package provides foundation classes for constructive policies, which build
solutions sequentially. It includes base encoders, decoders, and a unified
policy class.

Attributes:
    AutoregressiveEncoder: Abstract foundation for state encoding.
    AutoregressiveDecoder: Abstract foundation for sequential decoding.
    AutoregressivePolicy: Standard constructive policy implementation.
    ConstructivePolicy: General constructive method interface.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.models.common.autoregressive import AutoregressivePolicy
