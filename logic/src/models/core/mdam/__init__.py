"""MDAM: Multi-Decoder Attention Model.

This package provides MDAM for diverse solution generation. It uses a shared
encoder and multiple parallel decoders to branch out during construction.

Attributes:
    MDAM: Diverse training wrapper with competitive baseline.
    MDAMPolicy: Multi-path construction policy.
    mdam_rollout: Best-of-all rollout logic for baseline calculation.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.models.core.mdam import MDAM
