"""Neural Neighborhood Search (N2S).

This package implements the N2S architecture for iterative solution refinement.
It provides a specialized encoder with neighborhood masking and a pairwise
decoder for selecting local moves.

Attributes:
    N2S: Unified training and inference wrapper for neighborhood search.
    N2SPolicy: Policy coordinating N2S encoder and decoder.
    N2SEncoder: Sparse Transformer encoder with spatial neighborhood masking.
    N2SDecoder: Pairwise action decoder for move selection.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.models.core.n2s import N2S
