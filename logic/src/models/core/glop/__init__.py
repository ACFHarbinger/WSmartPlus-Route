"""GLOP: Global-Local Optimization Policy.

This package implements the GLOP architecture for large-scale routing. It
decomposes the problem into neural global partitioning and heuristic local
construction.

Attributes:
    GLOP: Unified training wrapper.
    GLOPPolicy: Hierarchical node partitioning policy.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.models.core.glop import GLOP
