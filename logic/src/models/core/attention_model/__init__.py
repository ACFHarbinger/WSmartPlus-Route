"""Attention Model-based routing components.

This package implements the Attention Model (AM) and its variants for
solving combinatorial optimization problems through constructive search.

Attributes:
    AttentionModel: The base encoder-decoder implementation.
    AttentionModelPolicy: RL4CO-compatible wrapper for training.
    DeepDecoderPolicy: Version with a multi-layer attention decoder.
    SymNCOPolicy: Invariant policy with a projection head.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.models.core.attention_model import AttentionModel
