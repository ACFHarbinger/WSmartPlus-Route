"""Neural Optimizer (NeuOpt) Model.

This module provides the `NeuOpt` wrapper (Ma et al. 2019), which leverages
neural networks to optimize combinatorial solutions by identifying and
applying high-quality local search moves.

Attributes:
    NeuOpt: Primary training and inference wrapper for the Neural Optimizer.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.models.core.neuopt.model import NeuOpt
    >>> model = NeuOpt(embed_dim=128, num_layers=3)
    >>> out = model(td, env)
