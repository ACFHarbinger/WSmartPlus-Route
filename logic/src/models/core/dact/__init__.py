"""DACT: Dual Aspect Collaborative Transformer.

This package implements the DACT architecture (Ma et al. 2021) for iterative
improvement of routing solutions. It decomposes the problem into spatial
(node) and sequential (tour position) aspects.

Attributes:
    DACT: Training and inference wrapper.
    DACTPolicy: Neural improvement policy.
    DACTEncoder: Dual aspect Transformer encoder.
    DACTDecoder: Pairwise move prediction decoder.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.models.core.dact import DACT
