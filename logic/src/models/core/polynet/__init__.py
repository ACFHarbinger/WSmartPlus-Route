"""PolyNet: Learning Diverse Solution Strategies.

This package provides PolyNet models that learn multiple distinct search
behaviors for combinatorial optimization using strategy conditioning and
the Poppy loss function.

Attributes:
    PolyNet: Training wrapper for multi-strategy learning.
    PolyNetPolicy: Behavior-conditioned construction policy.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.models.core.polynet import PolyNet
