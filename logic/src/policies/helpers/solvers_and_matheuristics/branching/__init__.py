"""Branching package for VRPP Branch-and-Price-and-Cut.

Provides several constraint types and the supporting B&B tree infrastructure.

Attributes:
    BranchAndBoundTree: Orchestrator for the B&B search process.
    EdgeBranchingConstraint: Constraint forcing/forbidding specific arcs.
    RyanFosterBranchingConstraint: Constraint forcing/forbidding node pairs together.
    FleetSizeBranchingConstraint: Constraint on total number of vehicles.
    MultiEdgePartitionBranching: Spatial fleet-partitioning heuristic.

Example:
    >>> tree = BranchAndBoundTree(root_node, strategy="ryan_foster")
    >>> tree.solve()

Theoretical Framework:
    Ryan-Foster branching is utilized for VRPP because it appropriately modifies
    the Resource-Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP) used for pricing by
    enforcing or forbidding node pairs. In a Set Partitioning Problem (SPP),
    node-pair branching is mathematically exact and avoids the "symmetry" issues
    inherent in arc-based branching for problems with multiple identical vehicles.
