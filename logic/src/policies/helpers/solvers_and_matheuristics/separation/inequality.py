"""VRPP Valid Inequality Definitions.

Defines the mathematical structures and facet forms for cutting planes used
to strengthen the LP relaxation of the Vehicle Routing Problem with Profits.

Attributes:
    Inequality: Base class for all valid inequalities in VRPP.
    PCSubtourEliminationCut: SEC specialized for profitable VRP.
    CapacityCut: Rounded Capacity Cut (RCC) for subset coverage.
    CombInequality: Classical comb inequality representation.

Example:
    >>> sec = PCSubtourEliminationCut(node_set={1, 2, 3}, violation=0.5)
    >>> cap = CapacityCut(node_set={1, 2}, total_demand=150, capacity=100, violation=0.2)
