"""
Sequential Selection Hyper-Heuristic (SS-HH) Module.

Implements the Sequential Selection Hyper-Heuristic framework for operator
selection and sequencing.  SS-HH maintains a performance score for each
low-level heuristic (LLH) and selects the next operator to apply according
to one of three selection strategies:

  - Greedy (ε = 0): always pick the highest-scoring operator.
  - ε-Greedy: exploit the best with probability (1 − ε), explore randomly
    with probability ε.
  - Softmax (Boltzmann): sample proportional to exp(score / temperature),
    giving a smooth trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

Scores are updated after each operator application using one of:
  - Additive reinforcement: score += improvement.
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA): score ← (1 − α) · score + α · reward.
  - Sliding-window average: maintain the last W observations and use their mean.

The operator returns a scored selection state object that persists across
iterations, enabling online learning of which operators are most effective
for the current problem instance.
