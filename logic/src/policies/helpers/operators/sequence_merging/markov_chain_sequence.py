"""
Markov Chain Sequence Sampler Module.

Implements a Markov Chain–based hyper-heuristic that samples operator execution
sequences from a learned transition probability matrix T, where T[i][j] is the
probability of applying operator j immediately after operator i.

The transition matrix can be:
  - Initialised uniformly (equal probability for all successors).
  - Updated online via exponential moving average (EMA) based on observed
    quality improvements.
  - Fitted to historical execution logs via maximum-likelihood estimation.

This allows the system to learn which operator orderings tend to produce
good improvements and to sample those orderings preferentially during search.
