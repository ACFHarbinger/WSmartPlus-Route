"""
Double-Bridge Move (Random 4-opt) Perturbation Module.

Implements the double-bridge move, a classical 4-opt perturbation that
slices a route into 4 segments by choosing 3 random cut points and
reconnects them in a non-sequential order to escape local optima.

Given segments A, B, C, D the reconnection is: A + C + B + D.
This creates a configuration that cannot be reached by any sequence of
2-opt or 3-opt moves, making it a powerful diversification tool.

Attributes:
    None

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.helpers.operators.perturbation.double_bridge import double_bridge
    >>> # Using LocalSearch
    >>> success = double_bridge(ls, r_idx=0, rng=rng)
    >>> # Using raw route plan
    >>> success = double_bridge(plan, r_idx=0, rng=rng)

    Double-bridge (4-opt) perturbation on a single route.

    Supports both LocalSearch instances and raw route plans (List[List[int]]).
    Selects 3 random cut points, slicing the route into 4 segments
    A, B, C, D and reconnects as A + C + B + D.

    Args:
        ls_or_plan: LocalSearch instance or List[List[int]] route plan.
        r_idx:      Index of the route to perturb.
        rng:        Random number generator (Random or np.random.Generator).

    Returns:
        bool: True if the move was applied, False otherwise.
