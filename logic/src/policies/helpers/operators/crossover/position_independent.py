    """
    Position Independent Crossover (PIX) for VRP.
    Based on the Uniform Crossover for Permutations (Syswerda, 1991).

    Algorithm:
        1. For each position in the giant tour, randomly decide (50/50)
           whether to inherit the node from Parent 1 at that position.
        2. Fixed positions from Parent 1 are copied into the child.
        3. Remaining positions are filled by the remaining nodes from
           Parent 2, preserving Parent 2's relative ordering.

    This operator focuses on preserving the absolute positions of a subset of
    nodes from one parent and the relative order of the rest from the other.

    Args:
        p1: First parent individual.
        p2: Second parent individual.
        rng: Random number generator.
        mandatory_nodes: List of nodes that MUST be visited.

    Returns:
        Child individual.
