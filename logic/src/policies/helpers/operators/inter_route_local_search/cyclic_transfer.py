"""
Cyclic Transfer (p-exchange) Operator Module.

Generalizes the swap operator across *p* routes.  Given p routes and one
selected node per route, the nodes are moved in a cyclic permutation:

    Route_0 donates node_0 → Route_1
    Route_1 donates node_1 → Route_2
    ...
    Route_{p-1} donates node_{p-1} → Route_0

The operator evaluates both forward and backward cyclic shifts and applies
the best improving configuration.

Attributes:
    None

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.helpers.operators.inter_route.cyclic_transfer import cyclic_transfer
    >>> improved = cyclic_transfer(ls, [(r0, p0), (r1, p1), (r2, p2)])
