"""
k-opt* Inter-Route Operator Module.

This module implements the generalized k-opt* inter-route operator, which
exchanges tails across *k* distinct routes by cutting each route at a given
node and reassigning the resulting tails to different routes.

Provides the unified ``move_kopt_star`` function and convenience wrappers:

- ``move_2opt_star`` → delegates to ``move_kopt_star`` with 2 cuts
- ``move_3opt_star`` → delegates to ``move_kopt_star`` with 3 cuts

Higher values of *k* enumerate all k!−1 non-identity permutations of
tail assignments and apply the best improving configuration.

Attributes:
    None

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.helpers.operators.inter_route.k_opt_star import move_kopt_star
    >>> improved = move_kopt_star(ls, [(u, r_u, p_u), (v, r_v, p_v)])
    >>> improved = move_kopt_star(ls, [(u, r_u, p_u), (v, r_v, p_v), (w, r_w, p_w)])
