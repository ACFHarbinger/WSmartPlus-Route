Branch-and-Bound (LDS) Insertion Repair Operator Module.

This module implements the re-insertion procedure described in Section 2.2 of:

    Shaw, P. (1998). Using Constraint Programming and Local Search Methods to
    Solve Vehicle Routing Problems. In Proceedings of the 4th International
    Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP-98),
    Lectures Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 1520, Springer, pp. 417-431.

The operator re-inserts a set of removed visits into a partial plan via a
depth-first **Branch-and-Bound tree search** augmented with **Limited
Discrepancy Search** (LDS, Harvey & Ginsberg 1995).

LDS Logic:
    The first choice made by the heuristic (cheapest insertion) at each level
    costs 0 discrepancy. The k-th alternative costs (k-1) discrepancy units.
    The search terminates once the max discrepancy budget is reached. This
    effectively explores the "neighborhood" of the greedy heuristic path.

Algorithm (Section 2.2):
    Variable Selection  — Farthest Insertion (Section 2.2.1):
        Choose the unrouted visit v whose cheapest feasible insertion cost
        is highest ("farthest" in insertion-cost space), i.e., the visit that
        would be hardest to insert later. This front-loads the most
        constrained decisions.

    Value Selection — Cheapest First:
        Enumerate all feasible (route, position) pairs for v, sorted by
        increasing insertion cost delta. The first value is the heuristic
        choice (0 discrepancy consumed); each subsequent value costs one
        additional discrepancy unit.

    Pruning:
        If the partial plan cost (already-routed edges + a naive lower bound
        of zero for the unrouted visits) already equals or exceeds the best
        complete plan found so far, prune the branch.

    Termination:
        The tree terminates when all visits are placed (complete plan) or no
        discrepancy budget remains (leaf node) or pruned.

Two public function pairs are provided:

    * ``bb_insertion``        — standard, distance-minimising variant (CVRP).
    * ``bb_profit_insertion`` — profit-maximising VRPP variant with optional
                               speculative seeding of new routes.

Both share the internal recursive LDS engine ``_lds_reinsert``.

    Implements ``Reinsert(plan, visits, discrep)`` from Figure 2 of Shaw
    (1998).  The *best_state* list is used as a mutable singleton reference to
    propagate the globally optimal plan across recursive frames.

    Algorithm:
        1. **Base case:** if *unrouted* is empty, check whether the completed
           plan improves on the best known and update accordingly.
        2. **Variable selection:** apply Farthest Insertion ordering — select
           the visit *v* whose cheapest feasible insertion cost is the largest.
           This maximally constrains the search early and mimics Section 2.2.1.
        3. **Value ordering:** enumerate all feasible positions for *v*, sorted
           by increasing cost delta (cheapest first), matching the paper's
           cheapest-insertion value heuristic.
        4. **LDS branching:** the first position (the heuristic's first choice)
           costs 0 discrepancy.  Each subsequent position costs 1 discrepancy
           unit; a branch is abandoned once ``discrep < 0``.
        5. **Pruning:** before recursing, check if the current plan cost already
           exceeds the best known.  If the current objective already dominates
           the pruning bound, skip the subtree.

    """Re-insert removed visits using Branch-and-Bound with Limited Discrepancy Search.

    Implements the ``Reinsert`` procedure from Section 2.2 of Shaw (1998).
    The operator explores the insertion search space via a depth-first tree
    search using:

    * **Farthest-Insertion** variable ordering (Section 2.2.1) — the most
      constrained visit (highest cheapest-insertion cost) is branched on first.
    * **Cheapest-first** value ordering — positions are tried in order of
      increasing insertion cost delta.
    * **LDS** discrepancy management — the i-th value choice at any node costs
      i discrepancy units; the budget is ``max_discrepancy``.
    * **Cost pruning** — branches where the accumulated cost cannot improve on
      the best complete plan found so far are abandoned.

    The best complete plan found within the LDS budget is returned.  If the
    budget is zero, only the greedy first-choice path is explored (equivalent
    to a deterministic cheapest insertion with farthest-first ordering).

    Args:
        routes: Partial plan; a list of customer sequences for each vehicle.
            The depot is implicitly node 0 and is NOT stored inside routes.
        removed_nodes: List of customer indices to be re-inserted.
        dist_matrix: Square distance matrix of shape ``(N+1, N+1)`` where
            index 0 is the depot.
        wastes: Mapping from node index to demand (waste volume).
        capacity: Maximum load per vehicle.
        max_discrepancy: LDS discrepancy budget *d*.  Larger values explore
            more alternatives at the cost of exponential tree growth.
            Shaw (1998) used *d = 1* for VRP; *d = 2* trades quality for
            speed.  Recommended: 1–3.
        mandatory_nodes: Optional list of node indices that must be inserted
            into the plan regardless of feasibility (each is given its own
            route as a last resort).
        expand_pool: If True, all currently unvisited nodes are treated as
            candidates, not only those in *removed_nodes*.  Set False for
            strict ALNS mode.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: Updated routes after inserting the removed visits.
            Empty routes are stripped from the result.

    Note:
        Implements Reinsert (Shaw 1998 §2.2):
        1. Uses Farthest-Insertion variable selection.
        2. Uses Limited Discrepancy Search (LDS) for tree management.
        3. Branches match the greedy path at zero discrepancy.

    """Re-insert removed visits via LDS tree search, maximising route profit.

    VRPP adaptation of ``bb_insertion``.  Extends the Shaw (1998) framework
    with profit-aware scoring (revenue - cost) and speculative seeding of new
    routes via a hurdle threshold.

    The search objective is to maximise the aggregate plan profit:

        profit = Σ_route [ R * Σ_v waste(v)  -  C * route_distance ]

    Non-mandatory nodes that have no profitable insertion option are silently
    dropped (consistent with the opt-in philosophy of VRPP).

    Args:
        routes: Partial plan (list of customer sequences, depot implicit).
        removed_nodes: Customer indices to be re-inserted.
        dist_matrix: Square distance matrix (depot at index 0).
        wastes: Node demand lookup.
        capacity: Maximum vehicle load.
        R: Revenue per unit of waste collected.
        C: Cost per unit of distance.
        max_discrepancy: LDS discrepancy budget.  Values of 1–3 are practical
            for ALNS repair calls.  Defaults to 2.
        mandatory_nodes: Nodes that must appear in the final plan.
        expand_pool: If True, all unvisited nodes are candidates (VRPP
            exploration mode).  Defaults to False (strict ALNS mode).
        seed_hurdle_factor: Fraction of new-route round-trip cost used as the
            minimum acceptable profit for opening a new route.  A value of 0.5
            means the node's profit must cover at least 50 % of its travel
            cost.  Defaults to 0.5 (matching other operators in the package).

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: Updated routes after profit-maximising insertion.
