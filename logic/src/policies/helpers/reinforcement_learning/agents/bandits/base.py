"""Base Bandit Module.

This module defines the abstract base class for Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) agents,
providing core functionality for statistics tracking, state persistence, and
incremental updates.

Attributes:
    BanditAgent: Abstract base class for all bandit agents.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.helpers.reinforcement_learning.agents.bandits.base import BanditAgent
    >>> # Note: BanditAgent is abstract and cannot be instantiated directly.
