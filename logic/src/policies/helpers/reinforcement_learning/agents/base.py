"""Base Agent Module.

This module defines the abstract base class for all Reinforcement Learning (RL)
agents in the system, establishing a common interface for action selection,
updates, and state persistence.

Attributes:
    RLAgent: Abstract base class for all RL agents.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.helpers.reinforcement_learning.agents.base import RLAgent
    >>> # RLAgent is abstract and should be subclassed.
