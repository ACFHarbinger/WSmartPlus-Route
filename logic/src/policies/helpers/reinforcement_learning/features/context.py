"""Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit for Crossover Operator Selection.

This module implements contextual bandits (LinUCB, Thompson Sampling) for
dynamically selecting crossover operators based on population context.

Context Features:
    - Population diversity (measured by genetic distance)
    - Parent fitness similarity
    - Convergence rate (improvement velocity)
    - Iteration phase (early/mid/late)
    - Parent quality (elite vs non-elite)

Algorithms:
    1. **LinUCB (Linear Upper Confidence Bound)** - Li et al., 2010
       - Linear model with UCB exploration bonus
       - Efficient for contextual bandits

    2. **Thompson Sampling (Contextual)** - Agrawal & Goyal, 2013
       - Bayesian approach with posterior sampling
       - Excellent exploration-exploitation balance

    3. **ε-Greedy Contextual** - Baseline
       - Simple ε-greedy with context-aware rewards

Attributes:
    ContextFeatureExtractor: Class for extracting context features from population state.

Example:
    >>> extractor = ContextFeatureExtractor()
    >>> features = extractor.extract_features(p1, p2, population, iteration=100)
