"""
Branch-and-Bound Policy Module.

This package implements the foundational Branch-and-Bound (BB) algorithm for exact
combinatorial optimization, specifically specialized for the Vehicle Routing
Problem with Profits (VRPP) and Capacitated Waste Collection VRP (CWC VRP).

Implementation follows the methodology proposed by Land and Doig (1960), utilizing
Linear Programming (LP) relaxations to provide rigorous mathematical bounds during
tree exploration.

**Architecture**:
- `mtz.py`: MTZ (Miller-Tucker-Zemlin) compact formulation
- `dfj.py`: DFJ (Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson) lazy cut formulation
- `dispatcher.py`: Unified interface for formulation selection
- `policy_bb.py`: Policy adapter integrating with the simulation framework
