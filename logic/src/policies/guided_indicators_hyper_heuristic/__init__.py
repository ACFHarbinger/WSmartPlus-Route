GIHH (Hyper-Heuristic with Two Guidance Indicators) policy module.

This module implements a selection hyper-heuristic that uses two guidance
indicators to adaptively select low-level heuristics during search:
1. Improvement Rate Indicator (IRI): Measures solution quality improvement
2. Time-based Indicator (TBI): Measures computational efficiency
