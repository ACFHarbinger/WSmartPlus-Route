Randomized Variable Neighborhood Descent (RVND) Implementation.

This module implements the strict RVND procedure as defined in:
    Subramanian, A., Drummond, L. M. A., Bentes, C., Ochi, L. S., & Farias, R. (2013).
    "A parallel heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery".
    Computers & Operations Research, 40(7), 1899-1911.

RVND systematically explores multiple neighborhood structures in a randomized sequence.
When an improvement is found in any neighborhood, the search restarts with a fresh,
reshuffled neighborhood list. The algorithm terminates only when all neighborhoods
have been explored without finding any improvement.

class RVND:
    """
    Randomized Variable Neighborhood Descent.

    Implements the RVND metaheuristic that explores multiple neighborhood structures
    in a randomized order. Unlike standard VND with a fixed neighborhood ordering,
    RVND randomizes the sequence and resets it completely upon finding any improvement.

    The algorithm maintains a neighborhood list (NL) of operator indices. At each step:
    1. A random neighborhood is selected from NL
    2. The corresponding operator is applied to the current solution
    3. If improvement is found:
       - Accept the improved solution
       - Reset and reshuffle NL to include all neighborhoods again
    4. If no improvement is found:
       - Remove the tested neighborhood from NL
    5. Terminate when NL is empty (local optimum reached)

    This randomization strategy prevents the algorithm from getting stuck in patterns
    and provides better exploration of the solution space.
