    Configuration for the OBA solver.

    OBA uses a non-monotonic oscillating threshold.  The threshold dilates
    (becomes more permissive) after consecutive rejections and contracts
    (becomes stricter) after consecutive acceptances.

    Attributes:
        dilation: Amount to widen threshold after a rejection.
        contraction: Amount to tighten threshold after an acceptance.
        max_iterations: Total LLH applications.
        n_removal: Nodes removed per destroy step.
        n_llh: Number of LLHs in the pool.
        time_limit: Wall-clock time limit in seconds.
