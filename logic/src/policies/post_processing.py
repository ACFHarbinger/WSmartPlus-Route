"""
Post-Processing module for routing solutions.

This module provides a modular framework for refining tours generated by
base routing policies. It follows the Registry/Factory pattern to support
various refinement strategies like Fast TSP, Vectorized 2-opt, Swap, etc.

This module acts as a facade, re-exporting components from the
.post_processing sub-package for backward compatibility.
