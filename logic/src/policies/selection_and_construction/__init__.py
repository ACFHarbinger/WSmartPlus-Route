"""Selection and Construction Policies Package.

This package contains algorithms that perform **joint** mandatory-bin selection
and route construction in a single integrated optimization loop, rather than
executing the two phases sequentially.

The package exposes the main factory and registry for joint policies, as well
as the specific implementations for Greedy Orienteering, Simulated Annealing,
and NDS-BRKGA.

Attributes:
    BaseJointPolicy: Base class for joint policies.
    JointPolicyFactory: Factory for creating joint policies.
    JointPolicyRegistry: Registry of available joint policies.
    JointGreedyParams: Parameters for JGO.
    JointGreedyPolicy: JGO policy implementation.
    JointSAParams: Parameters for JSA.
    JointSAPolicy: JSA policy implementation.
    NDSBRKGAParams: Parameters for NDS-BRKGA.
    NDSBRKGAPolicy: NDS-BRKGA policy implementation.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.selection_and_construction import JointPolicyFactory
    >>> policy = JointPolicyFactory.create("nds_brkga", config=cfg)
