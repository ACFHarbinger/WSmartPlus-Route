"""NDS-BRKGA sub-package.

Exposes the public API of the Non-Dominated Sorting Biased Random-Key
Genetic Algorithm (NDS-BRKGA) core components.

Attributes:
    NDSBRKGAPolicy (Type[NDSBRKGAPolicy]): Main policy for joint selection and construction.
    NDSBRKGAParams (Type[NDSBRKGAParams]): Hyperparameter configuration dataclass.
    Chromosome (Type[Chromosome]): Representation of a solution candidate.
    Population (Type[Population]): Manager for solution candidates and evolution.
    biased_crossover (Callable): Biased uniform crossover operator.
    fast_non_dominated_sort (Callable): NSGA-II sorting algorithm.
    crowding_distance (Callable): Crowd distance assignment for diversity.
    select_elite_nsga2 (Callable): Pareto-based elite selection.
    compute_overflow_risk (Callable): Risk calculation utility.
    evaluate_chromosome (Callable): Single candidate objective evaluator.
    evaluate_population (Callable): Batch population evaluator.
    compute_adaptive_thresholds (Callable): Dynamic selection threshold calculator.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.selection_and_construction.non_dominated_sorting_biased_random_key_genetic_algorithm import NDSBRKGAPolicy
    >>> policy = NDSBRKGAPolicy()
