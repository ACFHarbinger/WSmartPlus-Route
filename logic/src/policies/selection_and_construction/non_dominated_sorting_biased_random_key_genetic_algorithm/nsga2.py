"""NSGA-II Non-Dominated Sorting and Crowding Distance Module.

Implements the fast non-dominated sorting algorithm and crowding-distance
assignment from Deb et al. (2002) for extracting an elite subset from the
NDS-BRKGA population.

Algorithm
---------
1.  **Fast Non-Dominated Sort**:  Partition the population into fronts
    ``F₁, F₂, …`` such that every solution in ``Fₖ`` is dominated by at
    least one solution in ``Fₖ₋₁``.  Complexity ``O(M × N²)`` where ``M``
    is the number of objectives and ``N`` is population size.

2.  **Crowding Distance**:  For each solution on a given front, compute the
    average side-length of the cuboid formed by its two neighbours in each
    objective dimension.  Boundary solutions receive distance ``∞``.

3.  **Elite Extraction**:  Fill the elite pool front-by-front.  When the
    next complete front would overflow the budget, rank its members by
    crowding distance (larger = more isolated = more diverse = preferred).

Attributes:
    fast_non_dominated_sort: Pareto layer extractor.
    crowding_distance: Diversity metric calculator.
    select_elite_nsga2: Main selection interface.

Example:
    >>> fronts = fast_non_dominated_sort(objectives)
    >>> dists = crowding_distance(fronts[0], objectives)
