BRKGA Chromosome Module.

Defines :class:`Chromosome`, the fundamental unit of the NDS-BRKGA population.

Encoding
--------
A chromosome is a vector ``keys`` of length ``2 * N`` where ``N`` is the number
of candidate bins:

* **Selection keys** ``keys[0:N]``:  bin ``i`` (0-indexed) is selected if
  ``keys[i] > threshold_i``, where ``threshold_i`` is computed **per-bin**
  from the normalised overflow risk (adaptive threshold).

* **Routing keys** ``keys[N:2N]``:  the visit order of the selected bins is
  determined by ``argsort(keys[N + j] for j in selected_indices)`` — lower
  routing key → visited earlier.

Adaptive Threshold
------------------
The per-bin selection threshold is::

    threshold_i = threshold_max - (threshold_max - threshold_min)
                  × normalised_risk_i

where ``normalised_risk_i = overflow_risk_i / max(overflow_risk)`` is in
``[0, 1]``.  A bin with maximum overflow risk therefore has
``threshold_i = threshold_min`` (≈ 0.10), making any random key above 0.10
trigger its selection.  A bin with zero risk has ``threshold_i = threshold_max``
(≈ 0.90), requiring a very high key before being selected.

Route Decoding
--------------
After selection, a greedy capacity-constrained packing phase splits the ordered
sequence of selected bins into feasible vehicle routes.  The packing respects
``capacity`` in kg (using the fill percentages converted to mass via
``bin_density × bin_volume / 100``).

Attributes:
    Chromosome: Data class for BRKGA chromosomes.

Example:
    >>> keys = np.random.uniform(0, 1, size=20)
    >>> chrom = Chromosome(keys, n_bins=10)
    >>> print(chrom.n_bins)
    10
