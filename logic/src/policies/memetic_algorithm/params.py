Configuration parameters for the Memetic Algorithm (MA) solver.

This module defines the parameters used by the MASolver, mapped to the framework
proposed in the seminal work:

    """
    Hyper-parameters for the Memetic Algorithm (MA) solver.

    The paper defines a Memetic Algorithm as the synergistic combination of
    population-level evolutionary search (Genetic Algorithm) and individual-level
    intensive refinement (Local Search / Individual Search).

    Paper Concept Mapping:
    - pop_size: The constant size of the population denoted by |pop| in Fig. 3.1.
    - max_generations: The number of times the Generational Step is executed.
    - recombination: Controlled by crossover_rate within the reproduction pipeline (Fig. 3.2).
    - mutation: Controlled by mutation_rate and n_removal (p. 4).
    - local_improver: Intensive hill-climbing defined in Fig. 3.3.
    - replacement: Implements 'Plus' strategy for global elitism (p. 3).

    Attributes:
        pop_size: The number of active individuals in each generation (|pop|).
                  Determines the breadth of the global search.
        max_generations: The maximum number of generational iterations to perform.
        crossover_rate: The probability [0.0, 1.0] that two parents will
                         exchange information to create an offspring (Recombination).
        mutation_rate: The probability [0.0, 1.0] that a child will undergo
                       a random structural perturbation (Mutation).
        local_search_rate: The probability [0.0, 1.0] that the Local-Improver (Fig. 3.3)
                            will be applied to a newly generated offspring.
                            In many MAs, this is set to 1.0 for intensive search.
        tournament_size: The number of candidates selected for each fitness-based
                         competitive selection (Tournament Selection).
                         Higher values increase selection pressure.
        n_removal: The number of nodes removed and re-inserted during the
                   mutation operator. Represents the 'shake' magnitude.
        time_limit: Maximum wall-clock duration in seconds allowed for the search.
