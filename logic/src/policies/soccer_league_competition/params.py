    Configuration parameters for the Soccer League Competition (SLC) solver.

    Players are individual routing solutions organised into teams.  The
    globally best solution is designated the "superstar".  Inter-team
    competition uses probabilistic match outcomes; intra-team competition
    uses local perturbations.  Stagnant teams are fully regenerated.

    Attributes:
        n_teams: Number of teams in the league.
        team_size: Number of players per team.
        max_iterations: Maximum number of seasons (outer loop).
        stagnation_limit: Seasons without improvement before team regeneration.
        n_removal: Nodes removed per intra-team perturbation step.
        local_search_iterations: Number of local search iterations.
        time_limit: Wall-clock time limit in seconds.
