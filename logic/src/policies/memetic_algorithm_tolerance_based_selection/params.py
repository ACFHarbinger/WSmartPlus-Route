"""
Configuration parameters for Stochastic Tournament Genetic Algorithm (STGA).

This is the rigorous parameter mapping for the League Championship Algorithm (LCA)
with proper Operations Research terminology.

TERMINOLOGY MAPPING (LCA → MA-TS):
- n_teams → population_size
- tolerance_pct → tolerance_pct (UNCHANGED - critical LCA feature)
- crossover_prob → recombination_rate
- n_removal → perturbation_strength
- max_iterations → max_iterations

    """
    Parameters for Memetic Algorithm with Tolerance-based Selection (MA-TS).

    Algorithm Structure:
        1. Initialize population of N solutions
        2. For each generation:
            a. Round-Robin Schedule: Random pairwise matching
            b. For each match (i vs j):
                - Determine winner using infeasibility tolerance
                - If |fitness_i - fitness_j| ≤ tolerance: random winner
                - Otherwise: higher fitness wins
                - Loser generates new solution (recombination or mutation)
                - Loser ALWAYS accepts new solution

    KEY FEATURE: Infeasibility Tolerance
        Solutions with similar fitness compete randomly, preserving diversity
        and allowing exploration of alternative feasible basins. This is the
        distinguishing characteristic of LCA vs standard tournament GA.

    Attributes:
        population_size: Number of candidate solutions (LCA: n_teams).
        max_iterations: Maximum number of evolution cycles (LCA: max_iterations).
        tolerance_pct: Infeasibility tolerance as fraction of average fitness.
                      Solutions within this tolerance compete randomly.
                      (LCA: tolerance_pct). Typical: 0.01-0.10.
        recombination_rate: Probability of crossover vs mutation (LCA: crossover_prob).
        perturbation_strength: Number of nodes to remove in mutation (LCA: n_removal).
        local_search_iterations: Local search refinement iterations.
        time_limit: Wall-clock time limit in seconds (0 = no limit).

    Mathematical Foundation:
        Infeasibility Tolerance Formula:
            tolerance = tolerance_pct × (|fitness_a| + |fitness_b|) / 2
            if |fitness_a - fitness_b| ≤ tolerance:
                winner = random choice (diversity preservation)
            else:
                winner = argmax(fitness_a, fitness_b)

    Complexity:
        - Space: O(N × n) for population storage
        - Time per generation: O(N × eval_cost) for pairwise matches
