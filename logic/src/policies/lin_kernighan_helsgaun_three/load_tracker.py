"""
O(L) Exact Penalty Change Calculation for LKH-3 k-opt Pre-screening.

This module implements efficient load tracking and penalty delta computation
to avoid O(N) penalty recalculations in tight k-opt loops.

Mathematical Background
-----------------------
During k-opt search, we need to evaluate thousands of moves per iteration.
Computing full tour penalties via calculate_penalty() takes O(N) per move,
resulting in O(N^6) total complexity for 5-opt.

Solution: Maintain a load state that allows O(L) penalty delta queries,
where L is the length of affected routes (typically << N).

Key Insight: A k-opt move only affects the routes containing the broken edges.
For a tour with M routes, only 1-2 routes are modified per move, so we can
compute ΔP by:
1. Splitting the NEW tour into routes at dummy depots
2. Summing actual segment demands per route
3. Computing ΔP = P_new - P_old for affected routes

Complexity: O(L) where L = total length of affected routes (typically << N).

Data Structures
---------------
LoadState:
    route_assignments: Dict[int, int]  # node → route_id
    route_loads: Dict[int, float]      # route_id → total_load
    route_penalties: Dict[int, float]  # route_id → capacity_violation

Usage
-----
>>> state = build_load_state(tour, waste, capacity, n_original)
>>> delta_p = get_exact_penalty_delta(
...     new_tour=candidate_tour,
...     state=state,
...     waste=waste,
...     capacity=capacity,
...     n_original=n_original,
