"""
Graph Augmentation Module for LKH-3 Multi-Vehicle Support.

This module implements explicit dummy depot augmentation to avoid the catastrophic
NumPy negative-indexing bug. Instead of using negative indices (-1, -2, ...) which
wrap around in NumPy arrays, we explicitly append M-1 dummy depot nodes to the graph.

Mathematical Formulation
------------------------
Given an original graph with N nodes (0 = depot, 1..N-1 = customers) and M vehicles:

1. **Augmented Graph Size**: N + (M-1) nodes
   - Original nodes: 0, 1, ..., N-1
   - Dummy depots: N, N+1, ..., N+M-2

2. **Distance Matrix Augmentation**: (N+M-1) × (N+M-1)
   - Dummy depot rows/cols copy depot (node 0) distances
   - Inter-dummy distances set to HIGH_PENALTY to prevent empty routes

3. **Waste/Demand Augmentation**: Size N+M-1
   - Dummy depot demands set to 0

Architecture
------------
This augmentation happens at the POLICY level (policy_lkh3.py) before calling
the LKH-3 engine. The engine operates on the augmented graph with explicit dummy
indices, avoiding all NumPy indexing issues.

After LKH-3 completes, the tour is decoded by splitting at any node index >= N
(which are the augmented dummy depots).

Example
-------
>>> # Original: N=5 nodes (depot + 4 customers), M=3 vehicles
>>> dist_orig = np.array([[...]])  # (5, 5)
>>> waste_orig = {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 15, 4: 25}
>>>
>>> # Augment for 3 vehicles (adds 2 dummy depots at indices 5, 6)
>>> dist_aug, waste_aug, n_original = augment_graph(
...     dist_orig, waste_orig, n_vehicles=3
... )
>>> # dist_aug.shape = (7, 7)
>>> # waste_aug = {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 15, 4: 25, 5: 0, 6: 0}
>>> # n_original = 5
>>>
>>> # After LKH-3: tour = [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 0]
>>> routes = decode_augmented_tour(tour, n_original)
>>> # routes = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]  (split at indices >= 5)
