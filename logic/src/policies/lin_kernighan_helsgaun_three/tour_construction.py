"""
LKH-3 Tour Construction and Gain-Computation Module.

Provides tour initialisation, elite-tour merging, and the double-bridge
perturbation used by the LKH-3 iterated local-search loop, together with
exact gain formulae for 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-opt moves.

Tour construction
-----------------
_initialize_tour(distance_matrix, initial_tour) -> List[int]
    Return a closed starting tour.  If *initial_tour* is ``None`` a greedy
    nearest-neighbour construction heuristic is used (Helsgaun 2000,
    Section 4.4); otherwise the supplied tour is normalised to closed form.

merge_tours(tour1, tour2, distance_matrix) -> List[int]
    Pool-based recombination (Helsgaun 2000, Section 4.4).  Build a new tour
    by preferring edges shared by both inputs; fall back to nearest-unvisited
    selection whenever no shared edge is available.

Perturbation
------------
_double_bridge_kick(tour, distance_matrix, rng) -> List[int]
    Apply a double-bridge (random non-sequential 4-opt) perturbation by
    delegating to :func:`double_bridge` from the shared perturbation operator.
    The move cuts the route at three random positions and reconnects as
    A + C + B + D, producing a tour unreachable by any 2-opt or 3-opt move
    (Helsgaun 2000, Section 3.2 / ILS literature).

Exact gain functions
--------------------
The gain functions compute the net reduction in tour length if the named
edges are removed and the segments are reconnected in the specified pattern.
A positive value means the move is improving.

_2opt_gain(t1, t2, t3, t4, d) -> float
    Gain for removing (t1,t2) and (t3,t4):
    ``c(t1,t2) + c(t3,t4) − c(t1,t3) − c(t2,t4)``.

_3opt_gains(t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, d) -> List[float]
    Gains for all seven non-trivial 3-opt reconnection patterns (cases 0–6).

_4opt_gains(t1, …, t8, d) -> List[float]
    Gains for three common 4-opt reconnection patterns (cases 0–2).

_5opt_gains(t1, …, t10, d) -> List[float]
    Gains for five common 5-opt reconnection patterns (cases 0–4), covering
    the sequential 5-opt moves central to Helsgaun (2000), Section 4.3.

Dependencies
------------
- :class:`TourAdapter` from ``._tour_adapter`` to wrap tours for operator calls.
- :func:`double_bridge` from the shared perturbation operator package.

Typical usage
-------------
