"""
Steepest-Descent 2-opt Intensification Operator.

Drives a VRP solution to a strict intra-route 2-opt local minimum. At each
iteration the globally best improving edge-reversal move is located across
all routes and applied; the loop terminates once no improving move remains.

This is a pure intensification operator: it never changes which customers
are visited or which route they belong to. Route loads and revenue are
therefore guaranteed to be preserved. For VRPP problems the improvement
threshold is scaled by C so that comparisons remain in profit units.

The complexity per iteration is O(Σ_r n_r²) where n_r is the route length.
In practice the algorithm converges in far fewer iterations than max_iter.

    >>> improved = two_opt_steepest(routes, dist_matrix, wastes, capacity)

    ``route[i:j]`` only changes the two boundary edges.

    At every iteration the globally best improving segment-reversal is located
    across all routes and applied. The search terminates once no single 2-opt
    move improves the total travel cost.

    2-opt never changes route membership or the set of visited customers, so
    capacity constraints and revenue are always preserved. For VRPP problems
    set ``C`` to the cost-per-km so that the improvement threshold is correctly
    scaled in profit units; the stopping condition remains identical to CVRP.

    Args:
        routes: Current plan (list of customer sequences, depot implicit at 0).
        dist_matrix: Square distance matrix of shape ``(N+1, N+1)``, depot at
            index 0.
        wastes: Node demand lookup (unused; included for API consistency with
            all operators in this package).
        capacity: Maximum vehicle load (unused; 2-opt never moves customers
            between routes, so loads are unchanged).
        C: Cost per unit of distance.  Scales the improvement comparison; use
            ``1.0`` for pure distance minimization (CVRP), or the actual cost
            coefficient for VRPP profit weighting.
        max_iter: Maximum number of improvement iterations.  The search
            typically terminates well before this limit; the bound guards only
            against pathological instances.
