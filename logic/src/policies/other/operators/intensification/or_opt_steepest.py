"""
Steepest-Descent Or-opt Intensification Operator.

Or-opt relocates contiguous chains of 1, 2, or 3 nodes to better positions
within or across routes.  The steepest-descent variant evaluates every feasible
relocation at every iteration and applies the globally best improving move,
repeating until a strict Or-opt local minimum is reached.

The chain is always re-inserted intact (in its original node order), so no
capacity violation can arise within the chain itself.  Capacity is only checked
when the chain crosses a route boundary (inter-route relocation).

Because Or-opt repositions customers but never drops them, the set of visited
nodes does not change.  Revenue is therefore unchanged, making the CVRP and
VRPP stopping conditions equivalent: improving moves reduce distance cost by
more than an epsilon threshold (scaled by C for unit consistency).

The complexity per iteration is O(m² · n²) where m is the number of routes
and n is the average route length.  The algorithm converges quickly in practice.
