"""
Branch-and-Bound Removal (Destroy) Operator Module.

This module implements a destroy operator that selects which customer visits to
remove from the current plan using a **Branch-and-Bound** guided search
enhanced with **Limited Discrepancy Search** (LDS).

Conceptual Foundation
---------------------
Shaw (1998) Section 2 frames the ALNS cycle as a two-phase search:

    1. **Removal** (Figure 1): Select a set *V_r* of visits to remove from the
       current plan *P*.
    2. **Re-insertion** (Figure 2): Use a B&B/LDS search to find the best
       way to restore those visits.

This module implements a principled destroy companion to the
``branch_bound.py`` repair operator.  Rather than removing visits at random or
solely by worst-case detour cost, the operator scores each candidate node by
its **worst-recovery cost** — i.e., how expensive it would be to re-insert
that node into a plan from which it has just been removed.  Nodes with the
highest recovery cost are the most disruptive to remove, and are therefore
preferred (they create the largest perturbation in the plan's cost landscape).

The removal set is built iteratively using an LDS-bounded tree search that
controls how many "sub-optimal" choices (i.e., not the single most-disruptive
node) are allowed per selection step.  A discrepancy budget ``max_discrepancy``
caps the branching width; at ``max_discrepancy = 0`` the operator degenerates
to a deterministic greedy worst-recovery removal.

Algorithm
---------
    Step 1 — Score all routed nodes by their worst-recovery cost:

        recovery_cost(v) = min over all feasible positions (i, j) of
                           dist[prev(v), v] + dist[v, next(v)] - dist[prev(v), next(v)]

        This is the cheapest cost delta needed to re-insert *v* back into
        a plan that already has the other selected nodes removed.  A *high*
        recovery cost means *v* is expensive to put back = most disruptive to
        remove.

    Step 2 — Sort candidates by recovery cost descending (worst first).

    Step 3 — LDS branching: the first candidate costs 0 discrepancy; each
        subsequent candidate costs 1 discrepancy unit.  For each LDS branch,
        tentatively remove the chosen node and recurse to select the next.

    Step 4 — Pruning: if the current partial removal set's estimated cost
        savings (sum of detour costs of removed nodes) already cannot improve
        on the best removal set found so far, prune the branch.

Two public function pairs are provided:

    * ``bb_removal``         — standard cost-minimising variant (CVRP).
    * ``bb_profit_removal``  — profit-maximising VRPP variant that biases
                              selection toward low-profit nodes.

    The operator scores each routed node by its **worst-recovery cost** —
    the cheapest cost delta needed to re-insert that node back into the plan
    (computed against the *current* partial plan as removals are applied).
    A node with a high recovery cost is maximally disruptive to remove.

    An LDS tree search enumerates removal sets of size *n_remove*, branching
    over the sorted candidate list.  The first candidate (highest recovery
    cost) is the heuristic choice (0 discrepancy); each alternative costs 1
    discrepancy unit.  The search terminates when the budget is exhausted or
    all removal sets of the required size have been enumerated.

    The removal set with the highest cumulative detour savings (i.e., the most
    disruptive removal) is chosen among all explored branches.

    Args:
        routes: Current plan (list of customer sequences, depot implicit).
        n_remove: Number of nodes to remove.
        dist_matrix: Square distance matrix of shape ``(N+1, N+1)`` where
            index 0 is the depot.
        wastes: Mapping from node index to demand (waste volume).
        capacity: Maximum vehicle load.
        max_discrepancy: LDS discrepancy budget *d*.  At *d = 0* only the
            greedy-best removal sequence is explored (deterministic).  At
            *d = 1* one alternative per step is tried.  Recommended: 0–2.
        rng: Optional random number generator.  If provided, a small random
            perturbation (scaled by *noise*) is added to candidate scores to
            break deterministic ties and introduce stochastic diversity.
        noise: Magnitude of Gaussian noise added to each recovery-cost score
            when *rng* is provided.  Set to 0 for deterministic mode.

    """Select nodes to remove via LDS, biasing toward low-profit customers (VRPP).

    VRPP adaptation of ``bb_removal``.  Instead of scoring nodes by
    worst-recovery cost, candidates are scored by their **marginal profit
    contribution** — nodes with the lowest (or most negative) profit are ranked
    first for removal, focusing the search on economically weak customers.

    The LDS branching scheme is identical to ``bb_removal``: the first
    candidate (lowest profit contribution) costs 0 discrepancy; alternatives
    cost 1 discrepancy unit each.

    Args:
        routes: Current plan (list of customer sequences, depot implicit).
        n_remove: Number of nodes to remove.
        dist_matrix: Square distance matrix (depot at index 0).
        wastes: Node demand lookup.
        capacity: Maximum vehicle load.
        R: Revenue per unit of waste collected.
        C: Cost per unit of distance.
        max_discrepancy: LDS discrepancy budget.  Recommended: 0–2.
        rng: Optional random number generator for tie-breaking noise.
        noise: Magnitude of Gaussian noise added to profit scores when *rng*
            is provided.  Set to 0 for deterministic mode.

    Returns:
        Tuple[List[List[int]], List[int]]: Partial routes and removed node IDs.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If *n_remove* or *max_discrepancy* are negative.
