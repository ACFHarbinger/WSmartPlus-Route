"""
Guided Removal Operator Module for G-LNS.

This module implements the penalized removal heuristic, which targets nodes
involved in highly penalized edges as defined by Guided Large Neighborhood
Search (G-LNS). This helps the search explicitly break away from local
optima by removing features that the G-LNS mechanism has identified as
undesirable. This operator serves as the G-LNS equivalent of Fast Local
Search (FLS).

    Remove nodes associated with highly penalized edges in G-LNS.

    This operator serves as the stochastic LNS equivalent of Fast Local Search
    (FLS) sub-neighborhood activation. By scoring each node based on the sum
    of penalties of its incident edges and forcing the LNS ruin operator to
    deterministically bias the removal of these high-scoring nodes, it achieves
    the exact theoretical goal of FLS: focusing computational effort strictly
    on tearing down penalized features while allowing regret-based insertion
    to repair the sub-neighborhood.

    Args:
        routes: Current routes.
        n_remove: Number of nodes to remove.
        penalties: Edge penalty matrix from GLSSolver.
        p: Randomness parameter (p >= 1). Higher p = more deterministic.
        rng: Random number generator.

    Returns:
        Tuple[List[List[int]], List[int]]: Partial routes and list of removed node IDs.
