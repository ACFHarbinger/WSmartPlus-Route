"""
Profit-Similarity and Cluster Removal Operator Module.

This module implements removal heuristics based on spatial and attribute similarity.
Includes standard cluster removal (spatial) and profit-similarity removal (VRPP).

Attributes:
    None

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.other.operators.destroy.cluster import cluster_removal
    >>> routes, removed = cluster_removal(routes, n_remove=5, dist_matrix=d, nodes=all_nodes)
    >>> from logic.src.policies.other.operators.destroy.cluster import cluster_profit_removal
    >>> routes, removed = cluster_profit_removal(routes, n_remove=5, dist_matrix=d,
    ...                                              wastes=w, R=1.0, C=1.0)

    Remove a geographic cluster of nodes based on spatial proximity.

    **Paper Reference**: Pisinger & Ropke (2007), §5.1.4 — *Cluster Removal*.

    **Relationship to the Paper**: The cluster removal heuristic in the paper
    runs Kruskal's MST algorithm on the relatedness graph (using edge weight
    ``r_{ij}``) and terminates when two connected components remain.  One
    component is chosen at random and its nodes are removed.  If fewer than
    ``q`` nodes have been selected, the process is repeated on a different
    route.

    **This implementation** is a geographic-proximity simplification: it picks
    a random seed node and removes the ``n_remove - 1`` spatially closest
    nodes.  This is equivalent to the single-cluster phase of the paper but
    omits the iterative multi-route extension and the explicit MST computation.
    The simplification is appropriate for VRPP instances with a homogeneous
    fleet, where inter-request distance is the dominant relatedness component.

    Args:
        routes (List[List[int]]): Current routes.
        n_remove (int): Number of nodes to remove.
        dist_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix.
        nodes (List[int]): List of all node IDs.
        rng (Optional[Random]): Random number generator.

    Returns:
        Tuple[List[List[int]], List[int]]: Partial routes and list of removed node IDs.

    Remove a group of nodes based on similarity in their profit contributions.

    Unlike standard Cluster Removal which uses spatial proximity (Pisinger & Ropke 2007),
    this is a novel VRPP adaptation that destroys routes by targeting nodes with
    similar marginal profit levels, effectively isolating regions of equivalent
    unprofitability for the search to re-evaluate.

        routes (List[List[int]]): Current routes.
