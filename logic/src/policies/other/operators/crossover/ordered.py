    """
    Classical Ordered Crossover (OX1) for fixed-length permutations.

    Preserves absolute positioning of the segment from Parent 1, and
    circular relative positioning of the remaining nodes from Parent 2.
    Requires giant_tour to contain all nodes (visited + unvisited).

    Algorithm:
        1. Select random segment [a, b] from Parent 1
        2. Copy segment into child at EXACT same positions [a, b]
        3. Fill remaining positions by circularly sweeping Parent 2 from position (b+1)
        4. Skip nodes already in the segment

    This maintains:
        - Absolute positioning inheritance from Parent 1 (spatial traits)
        - Relative ordering inheritance from Parent 2 (sequential traits)
        - Fixed-length genotype for all nodes (visited + unvisited)

    Args:
        p1: First parent individual.
        p2: Second parent individual.
        rng: Random number generator.
        mandatory_nodes: List of nodes that MUST be visited.

    Returns:
        Child individual with fixed-length giant tour.
