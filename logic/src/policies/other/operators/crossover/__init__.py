Crossover Operators for Hybrid Genetic Search.

This module implements seven advanced crossover operators for VRP genetic algorithms:

1. **Ordered Crossover (OX)** - Davis, 1985
   - Preserves relative order of elements
   - Good for TSP-like problems

2. **Position Independent Crossover (PIX)** - Adapted for VRP
   - Focuses on which nodes to inherit, not their positions
   - Excellent for node selection in VRPP

3. **Selective Route Exchange Crossover (SREX)** - Custom
   - Exchanges complete routes between parents
   - Preserves good route structures

4. **Generalized Partition Crossover (GPX)** - Whitley et al., 2009
   - Graph-based recombination using common edges
   - Creates offspring from edge unions

5. **Edge Recombination Crossover (ERX)** - Whitley, 1989
   - Preserves edges from parents
   - Builds offspring by following edge adjacencies

6. **Capacity-Aware ERX (C-ERX)** - VRPP Adaptation
   - ERX with capacity constraints and profit tie-breaking

7. **Route-based Profit GPX (RP-GPX)** - VRPP Adaptation
   - GPX operating on decoded routes with profit packing
