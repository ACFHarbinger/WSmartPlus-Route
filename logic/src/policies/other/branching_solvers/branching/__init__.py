Branching package for VRPP Branch-and-Price-and-Cut.

Provides several constraint types and the supporting B&B tree infrastructure:

EdgeBranchingConstraint
    Operates on directed arcs (u → v).  Integrates cleanly with the DP label
    extension step: forbidden / required arcs are enforced in O(1) per
    extension without any post-hoc filtering.
    Reference: Barnhart et al. (1998), Section 4.

RyanFosterBranchingConstraint
    Operates on *node pairs* (r, s).  Requires routes to either always contain
    both nodes in the same route (`together=True`) or never contain them
    together (`together=False`).
    Reference: Ryan & Foster (1981), Proposition 1.

FleetSizeBranchingConstraint
    Operates on the total number of vehicles used (sum of lambda variables).
    Enforces a floor or ceiling on the total fleet size.

NodeVisitationBranchingConstraint
    Operates on a single node i. Enforces v_i = 0 (forbidden) or v_i = 1 (forced).

MultiEdgePartitionBranching
    Spatial fleet-partitioning heuristic. Uses polar mapping geometry to
    forbid sets of arcs across different branches, yielding stronger
    polyhedral divergence for anonymous fleets.
    Reference: Barnhart et al. (1998, 2000).

Theoretical Framework:
----------------------
Ryan-Foster branching is utilized for VRPP because it appropriately modifies
the Resource-Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP) used for pricing by
enforcing or forbidding node pairs. In a Set Partitioning Problem (SPP),
node-pair branching is mathematically exact and avoids the "symmetry" issues
inherent in arc-based branching for problems with multiple identical vehicles.
While Barnhart et al. (2000) avoids this for ODIMCF to maintain simple
shortest-path pricing, the RCSPP pricing in VRPP is already weakly NP-hard,
and node-pair constraints are easily integrated into the DP label extension.
