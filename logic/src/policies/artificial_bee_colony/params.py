    Mimics honey-bee foraging: each food source is a routing solution.
    Employed bees exploit their source; onlooker bees are directed by
    fitness-proportionate selection; scout bees reinitialise stagnant sources.

    Attributes:
        n_sources: Number of food sources (employed bees).
        limit: Trial counter threshold before a source is abandoned.
        max_iterations: Maximum ABC cycles.
        n_removal: Number of nodes removed per neighbourhood perturbation.
        local_search_iterations: Number of local search iterations.
        time_limit: Wall-clock time limit in seconds.
