    Best-First Search strategy: selects node with highest LP objective bound.

    While standard for various optimization problems, in the context of BPC
    for VRPP, it can be less efficient than Depth-First Search because it
    frequently jumps across different tree branches, preventing effective
    LP basis reuse.

    Characteristics:
    - Time complexity: O(n) per selection (linear scan for maximum)
    - Space complexity: O(n) where n is number of open nodes
    - Optimality guarantee: Yes (like all complete B&B strategies)
    - Basis reuse: Poor (jumps across different tree branches)

    Best used for:
    - Small VRPP instances where tree depth is limited.
    - Situations where proving optimality with the fewest nodes is
      prioritized over computational speed per node.

class DepthFirstSearch(NodeSelectionStrategy):
    """
    Depth-First Search strategy: selects deepest node in the tree.

    This is the preferred default strategy for the BPC solver as it:
    - Maximizes LP basis reuse by staying within the same branch.
    - Achieves significant speedups (often 3-5x) by resolving child LPs
      from the parent's basis using dual simplex.
    - Effectively leverages LP warm-starts as advocated by Barnhart et al. (1998, OR 46(3):316-329).

    Characteristics:
    - Time complexity: O(n) per selection (linear scan)
    - Space complexity: O(n) where n is number of open nodes
    - Optimality guarantee: Yes (explores entire tree if needed)
    - Basis reuse: Excellent (stays within same branch until fathomed)

    Best used for:
    - High-performance BPC on VRPP where LP solve time dominates.
    - Large instances where memory management of Basis information
      for Best-First search would be prohibitive.

    Implementation Note:
    ----------------------
    When combined with LP warmstarts, DFS can achieve 3-5x speedup on
    large multicommodity flow instances by reusing the basis from the
    parent node (Barnhart et al., 1998, OR 46(3):316-329, Section 5).

    The solver should leverage Gurobi's or CPLEX's basis warmstart
    capabilities by:
    1. Storing the basis from the parent node's final LP solve
    2. Loading this basis before solving the child node's LP
    3. Using dual simplex to resolve from the warmstart

    Logic:

    This strategy combines the speed of DFS in finding feasible solutions with
    the mathematical efficiency of BestFS in proving optimality.

    NOTE ON PERFORMANCE:
    Hybrid search is less efficient than pure DFS for resolving child LPs
    because the Best-Bound phase frequently jumps between branches, forcing
    frequent Basis invalidation and re-solving from scratch. It also occupies
    more memory than DFS as Basis information must be stored for all open
    nodes to maintain any hope of warm-starting.
