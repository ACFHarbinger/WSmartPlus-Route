"""
Policies Package.

This package contains all routing policies (classical, heuristic, and neural)
used for solving the Waste Collection Vehicle Routing Problem (WCVRP) and
its variants.

Attributes:
    ALNSParams (class): Parameters for ALNS.
    NeuralAgent (class): Neural policy wrapper.
    run_alns (function): Runs ALNS algorithm.
    run_hgs (function): Runs HGS algorithm.
    find_routes (function): Solves CVRP using classical heuristics.
    find_route (function): Solves TSP.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies import find_routes
    >>> routes = find_routes(distance_matrix, demands, capacity)
