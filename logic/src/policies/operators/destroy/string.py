"""
String Removal Operator Module.

This module implements the string removal heuristic, which removes contiguous
sequences (strings) of nodes from routes to preserve local structure while
creating gaps for re-insertion.

Attributes:
    None

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.operators.destroy.string import string_removal
    >>> routes, removed = string_removal(routes, n_remove=5, ...)

    Remove contiguous strings of customers to induce spatial slack.

    The key insight of SISR is that removing adjacent customers creates a large
    contiguous "hole" in the route, providing maneuverability for reinsertion.
    This also reduces the number of re-insertions needed compared to random removal.

    Args:
        routes: Current routes.
        n_remove: Number of nodes to remove.
        dist_matrix: Distance matrix (used for propagation).
        max_string_len: Maximum length of a string to remove.
        avg_string_len: Average string length (unused, kept for API compatibility).

    Returns:
        Tuple[List[List[int]], List[int]]: Partial routes and list of removed node IDs.
