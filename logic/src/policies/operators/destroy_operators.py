"""
Destroy Operators Module.

This module exposes the various destroy (removal) operators used in the
Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm.

Attributes:
    random_removal (function): Randomly removes nodes.
    worst_removal (function): Removes nodes with highest cost contribution.
    cluster_removal (function): Removes spatially clustered nodes.
    shaw_removal (function): Removes related nodes (distance/time/demand).
    string_removal (function): Removes contiguous sequences of nodes.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.operators import destroy_operators
    >>> routes, removed = destroy_operators.random_removal(routes, n=5)
