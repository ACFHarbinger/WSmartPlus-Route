"""
Whittle Index Selection Strategy Module.

Treats each bin as a restless armed bandit (RMAB). Each bin has two actions:
passive (let it fill) or active (collect). The Whittle index represents
the "subsidy for passivity" at which the decision-maker is indifferent
between the two actions. Bins with higher Whittle indices are prioritized.

This implementation uses a discretized MDP (20 states) and Value Iteration
to solve for the indifferent subsidy.
