"""
Marginal Profit-per-km Selection Module.

This module implements a routing-aware economic strategy. Unlike a pure revenue
strategy that naively selects bins based strictly on their valuable contents,
this strategy normalizes the expected revenue by the spatial cost required to
collect it. It naturally deprioritizes highly valuable but highly isolated bins,
acting as a robust proxy for marginal insertion cost.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.helpers.mandatory.selection_profit_per_km import ProfitPerKmSelection
    >>> strategy = ProfitPerKmSelection()
    >>> bins = strategy.select_bins(context)
