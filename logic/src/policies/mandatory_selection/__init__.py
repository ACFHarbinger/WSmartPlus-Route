"""Selection Strategy Implementations for WSmart-Route.

This package contains concrete implementations of the `MandatorySelectionStrategy`
interface. Strategies determine which bins must be collected on a given day
based on different criteria (fill levels, revenue, schedule, etc.).

Attributes:
    MandatorySelectionFactory: Factory for creating strategy instances.
    MandatorySelectionRegistry: Registry for mapping names to strategy classes.
    SelectionContext: Context object containing state for selection decisions.
    CombinedSelection: Strategy that combines multiple selection criteria.
    LastMinuteSelection: Simple threshold-based reactive strategy.
    RevenueThresholdSelection: Strategy based on estimated revenue.
    LookaheadSelection: Predictive strategy using future fill simulations.
    WhittleIndexSelection: RMAB-based priority ranking strategy.
    MIPKnapsackSelection: Exact multiple-knapsack optimization strategy.
    FPTASKnapsackSelection: FPTAS-based multiple-knapsack strategy.
    BernoulliRandomSelection: Stochastic selection with eligibility thresholds.
    CVaRSelection: Tail-risk based selection.
    DeadlineDrivenSelection: Temporal deadline-based selection.
    PortfolioDispatcher: Orchestrator for multiple concurrent strategies.
    ThompsonDispatcher: MAB-based adaptive strategy selection.
    FilterAndFanSelection: Local search based selection refinement.
    FractionalKnapsackSelection: Greedy net-profit density selection.
    KMeansGeographicSectorSelection: Cyclic zone-day selection.
    LagrangianSelection: Reduced-cost based selection.
    LearnedSelection: ML-imitation selection strategy.
    MultiDayOverflowSelection: Stochastic multi-period overflow probability.
    ParetoFrontSelection: Bi-objective urgency/cost selection.
    ProfitPerKmSelection: ROI-based selection proxy.
    RegularSelection: Fixed-frequency periodic selection.
    RolloutSelection: One-step rollout simulation strategy.
    SavingsSelection: Spatial-savings based selection.
    ServiceLevelSelection: Statistical confidence-bound selection.
    SetCoverSelection: Hub-based spatial coverage selection.
    SpatialSynergySelection: Neighbourhood-based opportunistic selection.
    StaggeredRegularSelection: Phase-staggered periodic selection.
    StochasticRegretSelection: Expected overflow regret selection.
    SubmodularGreedySelection: Facility-location coverage selection.
    SupermodularGreedySelection: Synergetic cluster selection.
    WassersteinRobustSelection: Distributionally robust selection.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.mandatory_selection import MandatorySelectionFactory
    >>> strategy = MandatorySelectionFactory.create_strategy("last_minute")
    >>> bins, ctx = strategy.select_bins(selection_context)
