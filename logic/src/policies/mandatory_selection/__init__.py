"""
Selection Strategy Implementations for WSmart-Route.

This package contains concrete implementations of the `MandatorySelectionStrategy`
interface. Strategies determine which bins must be collected on a given day
based on different criteria (fill levels, revenue, schedule, etc.).

Includes both:
- Single-instance selectors (for simulation): SelectionContext-based
- Vectorized selectors (for training): Batched PyTorch tensor operations

Attributes:
    CombinedSelector (class): Combines multiple selection strategies.
    LastMinuteSelector (class): Selects bins that are about to overflow.
    LookaheadSelector (class): Selects bins based on future fill predictions.
    ManagerSelector (class): Selects bins based on a manager agent's policy.
    RegularSelector (class): Selects bins based on fixed schedule frequency.
    RevenueSelector (class): Selects bins based on revenue potential.
    ServiceLevelSelector (class): Selects bins to maintain a service level.
    VectorizedSelector (class): Abstract base for vectorized selection.
    create_selector_from_config (function): Factory function for config-based creation.
    get_vectorized_selector (function): Factory function for vectorized selectors.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.mandatory import create_selector_from_config
    >>> selector = create_selector_from_config(config)
    >>> selected_nodes = selector.select(context)
