"""
Pareto-Front Selection Strategy Module.

This module implements a sophisticated combinatorial selection strategy based on
multi-objective optimization. Instead of relying on a single scalar score, it
evaluates bins on a bi-objective Pareto front:
    1. Urgency: Minimizing the expected days until overflow.
    2. Routing Efficiency: Minimizing the spatial distance to the depot (as a
       proxy for insertion cost).

Any bin that lies on the non-dominated Pareto front is strictly obligated for
collection. This ensures that the policy never leaves behind a bin that is either
critically urgent or trivially cheap to collect without a justified trade-off.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.helpers.mandatory.selection_pareto import ParetoFrontSelection
    >>> strategy = ParetoFrontSelection()
    >>> bins = strategy.select_bins(context)

        Selects the non-dominated set of bins based on urgency and routing cost.

        A pre-filtering step is applied using `context.threshold` to discard bins
        that have an abundance of remaining time (e.g., > 7 days). This prevents
        degenerate Pareto solutions where an empty bin is selected simply because
        it happens to be physically adjacent to the depot.
