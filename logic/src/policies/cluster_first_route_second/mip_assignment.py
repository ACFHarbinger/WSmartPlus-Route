"""
Mixed-Integer Programming Assignment Module for Fisher & Jaikumar Clustering.

This module implements an exact optimization approach for assigning nodes to seed
clusters using Gurobi's MIP solver. The formulation maximizes total profit
(revenue - cost) subject to capacity and assignment constraints.

This is an extension of the original Fisher & Jaikumar algorithm that uses
exact optimization instead of greedy heuristics for the assignment phase.
Specifically, we introduce a Prize-Collecting adaptation of the GAP
objective to handle profit-aware vehicle routing (VRPP).

    Assign nodes to seeds by solving the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP)
    as an exact Mixed-Integer Program using Gurobi.

    Ref: Fisher & Jaikumar (1981), Sultana & Akhand (2017).

    IMPORTANT: The 'maximize_profit' objective is a novel metaheuristic
    extension for Prize-Collecting VRPs (VRPP). It is mathematically
    distinct from the original GAP formulation presented in Sultana &
    Akhand (2017), which focuses solely on cost minimization.

    Mathematical Formulation (GAP):
        Minimize: Σ_i Σ_k (c_ik * x_ik)
        Subject to:
            Σ_k x_ik <= 1                    ∀i ∈ must_go  (assignment)
            Σ_i w_i * x_ik <= capacity       ∀k ∈ seeds    (capacity)
            x_kk = 1                         ∀k ∈ seeds    (seed constraint)
            x_ik ∈ {0, 1}                    ∀i, k

        Where:
            c_ik = D_Si + D_i0 - D_S (S=seed, i=node, 0=depot)

            Note: We explicitly enforce c_kk = 0. This is a mathematical necessity
            to isolate the marginal cost of node i's insertion into cluster k.
            Since node k is the seed of its own cluster, its "insertion cost"
            relative to itself is zero by definition, ensuring it remains the
            anchor of that cluster without solver-induced artifacts.
            R = revenue per unit of waste
            C = cost per unit of distance

    Args:
        seeds: List of seed node indices (one per initial cluster).
        must_go: List of all nodes that need to be assigned.
        wastes: Dictionary mapping node indices to waste quantities.
        capacity: Maximum vehicle capacity.
        R: Revenue per unit of waste (used only in maximize_profit mode).
        C: Cost per unit of distance (used only in maximize_profit mode).
        distance_matrix: Pre-computed all-pairs distance matrix.
        time_limit: Maximum time in seconds for optimization (default: 60.0).
            The actual time used is 20% of this value.
        objective: Objective function ("minimize_cost" or "maximize_profit").
            Use "minimize_cost" for benchmark comparisons against A-VRP dataset.

    Returns:
        List of clusters, where each cluster is a list of node indices.
        Returns None if Gurobi is unavailable or MIP fails.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If objective is not "minimize_cost" or "maximize_profit".

    Note:
        - Requires gurobipy with valid license.
        - If Gurobi is unavailable or MIP fails, returns None to signal fallback needed.
        - Allocates 20% of total time_limit to the clustering phase.
        - For benchmark compliance with A-VRP dataset, use objective="minimize_cost".

    Example (Benchmark Mode):
        >>> seeds = [5, 12, 20]
        >>> must_go = list(range(1, 21))
        >>> wastes = {i: 10.0 for i in must_go}
        >>> capacity = 100.0
        >>> R, C = 5.0, 1.0
        >>> distance_matrix = np.random.rand(21, 21)
        >>> # Minimize cost for benchmark comparison
        >>> clusters = assign_exact_mip(seeds, must_go, wastes, capacity, R, C,
