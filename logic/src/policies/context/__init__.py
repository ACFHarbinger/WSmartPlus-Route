"""
Context Package for Functional State Tracking.

Provides the typed ``SearchContext`` ledger and associated ``TypedDict``
metrics that flow immutably through the three-phase pipeline:

  Phase 1 — Mandatory Selection  : creates ``SearchContext``
  Phase 2 — Route Construction   : merges ``ConstructionMetrics`` / ``AcceptanceMetrics``
  Phase 3 — Route Improvement    : appends ``ImprovementMetrics``
