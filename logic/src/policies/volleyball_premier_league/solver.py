"""
Volleyball Premier League (VPL) algorithm for VRPP.

Models the optimization process as a professional volleyball season with
hierarchical population management. The algorithm maintains active teams
(competing) and passive teams (reserves) for balanced exploration-exploitation.

Key Features:
    - Dual population structure (2N teams: N active + N passive)
    - Competition phase: Ranking and tournament evaluation
    - Substitution operator: Diversity injection from passive teams
    - Coaching and learning: Weaker teams learn from top 3 performers
    - Elitism: Top performers preserved across iterations
