HGS Local Search operators package.

This package provides a comprehensive suite of local search operators for VRP:
- Move operators: relocate, swap
- Route operators: 2-opt, 3-opt, 2-opt*, swap*
- Perturbation operators: perturb, kick
- Destroy operators: random, worst, cluster, shaw, string removal (SISR)
- Repair operators: greedy, regret-2, regret-k, blink insertion (SISR)
- Exchange operators: or-opt, cross-exchange, ejection chain, λ-interchange
