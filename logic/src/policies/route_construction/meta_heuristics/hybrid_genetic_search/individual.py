HGS Individual Module.

This module defines the Individual class used in the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS)
algorithm. It represents a single solution in the population, storing genotype
(giant tour) and phenotype (routes), along with cost and fitness metrics.

Attributes:
    Individual: Class representing a single solution in the population.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.route_construction.meta_heuristics.hybrid_genetic_search.individual import Individual
    >>> ind = Individual(giant_tour=[1, 5, 2])

class Individual:
    """
    Individual solution representation for genetic algorithm.
    Follows Vidal et al. (2022) HGS-CVRP implementation with VRPP adaptations.

    Genotype/Phenotype Mapping:
        - Genotype: giant_tour (ordered list of all customer nodes, including unvisited)
        - Phenotype: routes (actual vehicle routes after Split algorithm)

    For VRPP (Vehicle Routing Problem with Profits):
        The Split algorithm may skip unprofitable nodes, creating a mismatch between
        genotype and phenotype. To maintain genetic consistency for crossover:

        1. giant_tour contains ALL nodes in a specific order (genotype)
        2. routes contains only visited nodes organized into vehicle routes (phenotype)
        3. Nodes in giant_tour but not in routes are implicitly "unvisited"
        4. Local search operators may move nodes between visited and unvisited sets
        5. Crossover operates on giant_tour, preserving genetic material for all nodes

    This approach (Option A: Implicit Dummy Route) treats unvisited nodes as being
    in a conceptual "dummy route" at the end of the giant tour.

    Attributes:
        giant_tour (List[int]): Ordered list of all customer nodes (genotype).
        fitness (float): Biased fitness score (to be minimized).
        profit_score (float): Net profit of the solution.
        cost (float): Total routing cost.
        revenue (float): Total revenue collected.
        is_feasible (bool): True if solution satisfies all constraints.
        capacity_violation (float): Total capacity excess.
        penalized_cost (float): Cost including penalty for violations.
        dist_to_parents (float): Average diversity distance to parents.
        rank_profit (int): Rank based on profit.
        rank_diversity (int): Rank based on diversity.
        is_coached (bool): True if individual has been improved by local search.
        expand_pool (bool): True if repair operators consider all unvisited nodes.

    Example:
        >>> ind = Individual(giant_tour=[1, 2, 3])
