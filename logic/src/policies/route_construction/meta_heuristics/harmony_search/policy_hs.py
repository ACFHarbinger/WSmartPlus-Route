    Harmony Search (HS) Policy - Music-Inspired Global Optimization.

    Harmony Search mimics the improvisation process of musicians to find an
    aesthetically pleasing harmony, which corresponds to the global optimum
    in optimization.

    Algorithm Components:
    1.  **Harmony Memory (HM)**: Stores a set of high-quality routing solutions.
    2.  **Improvisation**: Generates a new harmony by either (a) selecting from
        HM, (b) adjusting a value from HM, or (c) choosing a random value,
        guided by Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR) and Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR).
    3.  **Update**: Replaces the worst harmony in HM if the new harmony is
        superior.

    HS is known for its simplicity and ability to find near-optimal solutions
    rapidly across various combinatorial structures.

        Execute the Harmony Search (HS) metaheuristic solver logic.

        HS is a music-inspired metaheuristic based on the process of searching
        for a perfect state of harmony. In this implementation:
        - Harmony Memory (HM): Stores a population of good solutions.
        - Memory Consideration: New harmonies are constructed by choosing
          components from the HM with probability HMCR.
        - Pitch Adjustment: components chosen from memory are optionally
          modified with probability PAR.
        - Random Selection: Remaining components are chosen randomly to maintain
          diversity.
        This policy applies HS to the VRPP using discrete neighborhood operators
        for pitch adjustment.

        Args:
            sub_dist_matrix (np.ndarray): Symmetric distance matrix for the current
                sub-problem nodes.
            sub_wastes (Dict[int, float]): Mapping of local node indices to their
                current bin inventory levels.
            capacity (float): Maximum vehicle collection capacity.
            revenue (float): Revenue obtained per kilogram of waste collected.
            cost_unit (float): Monetary cost incurred per kilometer traveled.
            values (Dict[str, Any]): Merged configuration dictionary containing
                HS parameters (hm_size, HMCR, PAR, BW).
            mandatory_nodes (List[int]): Local indices of bins that MUST be
                collected in this period.
            **kwargs: Additional context, including:
                - search_context (Optional[SearchContext]): Context for tracking
                  recursive solver statistics.
                - multi_day_context (Optional[MultiDayContext]): Context for
                  inter-day state propagation.

        Returns:
            Tuple[List[List[int]], float, float]: A 3-tuple containing:
                - routes: Optimized collection routes (list-of-lists, local indices).
                - profit: Total calculated net profit (Total Revenue - Total Cost).
                - cost: Total travel cost calculated by the solver.
