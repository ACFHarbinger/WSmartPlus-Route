        ALNS is a powerful metaheuristic that iteratively improves a solution by
        applying a sequence of destruction (removal) and reconstruction
        (insertion) operators. The selection of operators is controlled by a
        roulette-wheel mechanism that adapts based on the historical performance
        of each operator in discovering high-quality solutions.

        Args:
            sub_dist_matrix: Symmetric distance matrix for the current
                sub-problem nodes.
            sub_wastes: Mapping of local node indices to their
                current bin inventory levels.
            capacity: Maximum vehicle collection capacity.
            revenue: Revenue obtained per kilogram of waste collected.
            cost_unit: Monetary cost incurred per kilometer traveled.
            values: Merged configuration dictionary containing
                ALNS parameters (iterations, cooling rate, operator weights).
            mandatory_nodes: Local indices of bins that MUST be
                collected in this period.
            kwargs: Additional context, including:
                - search_context (Optional[SearchContext]): Context for tracking
                  recursive solver statistics.
                - multi_day_context (Optional[MultiDayContext]): Context for
                  inter-day state propagation.

            Tuple[List[List[int]], float, float]: A 3-tuple containing:
