    Configuration parameters for MADP (Rigorous VPL Implementation).

    Population Structure:
        - Total solutions = 2N (N active + N reserve)
        - Active population: Competing solutions that undergo evolution
        - Reserve population: Diversity pool for diversity injection

    Core Phases:
        1. Solution Construction: Initialize 2N solutions (N active, N reserve)
        2. Competition (Ranking): Evaluate and rank active solutions by fitness
        3. Diversity Injection: Inject components from reserve population
        4. Elite-Guided Construction: Weaker solutions learn from top-k performers

    Attributes:
        population_size: Number of active solutions (N). Total = 2N with reserves.
                        (VPL: n_teams)
        max_iterations: Maximum number of evolution cycles (VPL: max_iterations).
        diversity_injection_rate: Probability of injecting diversity from reserves.
                                  (VPL: substitution_rate). Typical: 0.1-0.3.
        elite_learning_weights: Learning weights for top-k elite solutions.
                               (VPL: coaching_weight_1, coaching_weight_2, coaching_weight_3)
                               Must sum to 1.0. Best performer has highest weight.
        elite_count: Number of elite solutions preserved (VPL: elite_size).
                    Typically 3 for top-3 guidance.
        local_search_iterations: Local search refinement iterations per solution.
        time_limit: Wall-clock time limit in seconds (0 = no limit).
        vrpp: Whether to solve as a VRP with profits.
        profit_aware_operators: Whether to use profit-aware heuristics.
        seed: Random seed for reproducibility.
