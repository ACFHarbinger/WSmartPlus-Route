"""Branch-and-Cut (BC) solver for routing problems.

This module provides an exact Branch-and-Cut implementation for solving VRPP
and CWC VRP problems. It utilizes dynamic cut generation (separation) to
enforce subtour elimination and other valid inequalities within a MIP framework.

Attributes:
    run_bc_optimizer (function): Entry point for the Branch-and-Cut solver.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.route_construction.exact_and_decomposition_solvers.branch_and_cut import run_bc_optimizer
    >>> routes, obj = run_bc_optimizer(dist_matrix, wastes, capacity, R, C)

This module implements an exact branch-and-cut algorithm for VRPP based on
cutting plane methods from:
- Fischetti, M., Salazar González, J. J., & Toth, P. (1997).
  "A Branch-And-Cut Algorithm for the Symmetric Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem"
- Padberg, M., & Rinaldi, G. (1991). "A Branch-and-cut Algorithm for the Resolution
  of Large-scale Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problems"

The VRPP combines node selection (which nodes to visit) with routing optimization,
aiming to maximize profit (waste collected) minus travel cost.
