        Execute the Branch-and-Cut (BC) solver logic.

        This method coordinates an exact optimization search that strengthens linear
        programming (LP) relaxations using dynamically generated valid
        inequalities (cuts). The process alternates between branching on fractional
        variables and separating cuts—such as Subtour Elimination Constraints
        (SECs) and rounded capacity inequalities—to tighten the lower bounds
        until global optimality is reached or the gap threshold is met.

        In this implementation:
        - Cutting Planes: SECs are separated using min-cut algorithms (e.g.,
          Gomory-Hu trees or max-flow) on the fractional support graph.
        - Branching: Standard integer branching on arc selection variables.
        - Warm Start: Heuristics are used to find initial feasible solutions for
          early pruning.

        Args:
            sub_dist_matrix (np.ndarray): Symmetric distance matrix for the current
                sub-problem nodes.
            sub_wastes (Dict[int, float]): Mapping of local node indices to their
                current bin inventory levels.
            capacity (float): Maximum vehicle collection capacity.
            revenue (float): Revenue obtained per kilogram of waste collected.
            cost_unit (float): Monetary cost incurred per kilometer traveled.
            values (Dict[str, Any]): Merged configuration dictionary containing
                BC parameters (mip_gap, time_limit, cuts_enabled).
            mandatory_nodes (List[int]): Local indices of bins that MUST be
                collected in this period.
            **kwargs: Additional context, including:
                - search_context (Optional[SearchContext]): Context for tracking
                  recursive solver statistics.
                - multi_day_context (Optional[MultiDayContext]): Context for
                  inter-day state propagation.

        Returns:
            Tuple[List[List[int]], float, float]: A 3-tuple containing:
                - routes: Optimized collection routes (list-of-lists, local indices).
                - profit: Total calculated net profit (Total Revenue - Total Cost).
