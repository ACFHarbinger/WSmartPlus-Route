"""Cutting plane separation engines for Branch-and-Price-and-Cut algorithms.

Provides modular separation algorithms for VRPP-specific valid inequalities:
Provides modular separation algorithms for VRPP-specific valid inequalities:
- RCC (Rounded Capacity Cuts): Standard VRP cuts derived from bin-packing
  requirements (Lysgaard et al. 2004). Essential for problems with fractional
  load coverage.
- 3-SRI (Subset-Row Inequalities): Tightens the set partitioning relaxation
  for subsets of 3 nodes (Jepsen et al. 2008). These handle the "entanglement"
  of fractional routes that partially cover the same customer set.
- Fleet Cover: 0-1 knapsack covers derived from the global vehicle fleet
  limit (adapted from Balas 1975). These strengthen the fleet-size knapsack
  by lifting minimal covers on the route-selection variables.
- SEC (Subtour Elimination Cuts): Enforces connectivity for prize-collecting
  variants where the route must be a simple cycle connected to the depot.

Methodology:
    Each engine implements a `separate_and_add_cuts` method that inspects the
    fractional LP solution of the Master Problem, identifies violated
    inequalities from its specific family, and registers them into the MP's
    Gurobi model. The dual variables from these cuts are then passed back to
    the RCSPP pricing solver.

class RoundedCapacityCutEngine(CuttingPlaneEngine):
    r"""Rounded Capacity Cut (RCC) separation engine for VRPP Set Partitioning.

    Derived from the physical payload capacity (Q) of the fleet, RCCs are a
    standard family of valid inequalities for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing
    Problem (CVRP), adapted here for the VRPP Set Partitioning context.
    They enforce that the total flow crossing the boundary of a subset of nodes
    S must be sufficient to cover the total demand of S.

    Mathematical Formulation:
    -------------------------
    For a cluster of nodes S ⊆ N \ {0}, the RCC is defined as:
        ∑_{e ∈ δ(S)} x_e ≥ 2 * k(S)

    where:
    - δ(S) = {(i, j) ∈ E : i ∈ S, j ∉ S or i ∉ S, j ∈ S} is the edge cutset of S.
    - डिमांड(S) = ∑_{i ∈ S} q_i is the total demand requirement in S.
    - k(S) = ⌈ डिमांड(S) / Q ⌉ is the minimum number of vehicles required to
      service all customers in S given the capacity limit Q.
    - x_e = ∑_{k: e ∈ route_k} λ_k is the aggregated flow of edge e in the RMP solution.

    Theoretical Context:
    --------------------
    RCCs are polyhedrally stronger than simple connectivity constraints because
    they incorporate the physical resource constraint (Q). Since VRPP involves
    selecting nodes to visit, the Master Problem uses Set Partitioning, making
    RCCs essential for pruning fractional solutions where multiple routes
    "fractionally" visit nodes in a cluster without collectively satisfying
    the capacity logic.

    Separation Methodology:
    -----------------------
    This engine utilizes the separation framework of Lysgaard et al. (2004),
    supporting both heuristic (Tabu Search) and exact (Max-Flow Min-Cut)
    separation procedures. The separation operates on the support graph
    defined by edges with fractional flow x_e > 0.

    Integration with Pricing:
    --------------------------
    Dual variables associated with RCCs (dual_S) contribute to the reduced
    cost of labels in the RCSPP pricing subproblem. For every edge e in the
    boundary δ(S), the dual value π_S is subtracted from the edge cost.

class SubsetRowCutEngine(CuttingPlaneEngine):
    """Subset-Row Inequality (SRI) separation engine.

    The Subset-Row Inequalities are a class of Chvátal-Gomory rank-1
    inequalities derived from the Set Partitioning Problem (SPP) formulation.

    They are essential for tightening the LP relaxation when solving VRPs
    with column generation.

    Mathematical Formulation (3-SRI):
    ---------------------------------
    For a subset S of exactly |S| = 3 customer nodes, the 3-SRI (with p=2)
    is defined as:
        ∑_{k} ⌊ 1/2 * |S ∩ route_k| ⌋ * λ_k ≤ 1

    Logic:
    If three routes each visit exactly two nodes of the triplet S, the sum
    of their fractional variables λ_k cannot exceed 1.0. If it does (e.g.,
    three routes with λ_k = 0.5), the solution is fractional and violated.

    Theoretical Context:
    --------------------
    SRIs handle the "entanglement" of fractional routes. By penalizing
    routes that share too many nodes in a specified triplet, they force
    the branch-and-bound tree toward integer solutions. This implementation
    follows the separation logic established by Jepsen et al. (2008).

    Separation Methodology:
    -----------------------
    Heuristic search identifies candidate triplets where the sum of visitation
    variables y_i = ∑_{k: i ∈ route_k} λ_k is high. We specifically target
    triplets forming triangles in the fractional support graph.

    Integration with Pricing:
    --------------------------
    Specifically for 3-SRIs, the dual variables π_SRI modify the RCSPP label
    transition. A labeling state must track how many nodes of S it has
    visited. When the count transitions from 1 to 2, the dual value π_SRI
    is subtracted from the path profit (or added to reduced cost).

    """Fleet Cover Inequality (Edge-Clique) separation engine.

    This engine separates valid inequalities derived from conflict graphs
    on the route-selection variables. Specifically, it identifies cliques
    in the conflict graph of routes that compete for a shared resource
    (in this case, single-use of a directed arc or a total vehicle count).

    Mathematical Formulation:
    -------------------------
    For a physical edge e = (i, j), let C(e) be the set of all routes in
    the RMP that traverse edge e. The Edge-Clique inequality is:
        ∑_{k ∈ C(e)} λ_k ≤ 1

    Theoretical Context:
    --------------------
    Standard Set Partitioning restricts each node to one visit, but
    Edge-Clique inequalities extend this to the "edges" of the graph.
    They are derived by lifting minimal covers on the arc capacity knapsack,
    forming facets of the resulting knapsack polytope. This implementation
    adapts the Lifting and Cover Inequality (LCI) logic of Balas (1975)
    and Barnhart et al. (2000).

    Heuristic Separation:
    --------------------
    The engine computes the aggregated flow x_{ij} for every edge in the
    current solution. Edges where x_{ij} > 1.0 + ε are candidates for a
    clique cut. For anonymous fleets where route weights are uniform (=1),
    the lifting coefficient for all routes in the clique simplifies to 1.0.

    Operational Logic:
    ------------------

class KnapsackCoverEngine(CuttingPlaneEngine):
    """Separates Cover Inequalities for knapsack constraints in the Master Problem.

    In the VRPP context, this primarily targets the fleet size (vehicle limit)
    constraint (Σ λ_k ≤ K) or any other resource knapsacks. While simpler
    than a general knapsack with varied weights, cover cuts help strengthen
    the integrality of the master problem by excluding fractional solutions
    that exceed the logical resource boundary.

    Mathematical Formulation:
    -------------------------
    Given a knapsack constraint ∑ w_j x_j ≤ b, a set of routes C is a 'cover'
    if ∑_{j ∈ C} w_j > b. The resulting cover inequality is:
        ∑_{j ∈ C} λ_j ≤ |C| - 1

    Theoretical Rationale:
    ----------------------
    A cover inequality excludes the point where all routes in C are selected
    with fractional values that sum to more than the capacity b. For the
    fleet constraint (w_j = 1), a minimal cover is any subset C of size K+1.
    This implementation adapts the logic of Barnhart et al. (2000).

    Interaction with Master Problem:
    --------------------------------
    If a vehicle_limit (K) is explicitly set in the RMP, the fleet constraint
    already prevents the LP from selecting more than K total routes.
    However, cover cuts provide additional polyhedral strength by
    specifically targeting the most fractional routes in the solution.

    r"""
    Saturated-Arc Lifted Cover Inequality engine — the primary LCI mechanism
    described in Barnhart, Hane, and Vance (2000) §6.

    Algorithm (paper §6, Gu et al. 1995a):
    -----------------------------------------
    Finding the most violated Lifted Cover Inequality is theoretically NP-hard.
    Consequently, this module employs a heuristic mechanism to identify minimal
    covers derived from saturated arcs in the fractional support graph.

    For each ARC (i, j) that is saturated in the current LP solution
    (i.e., fractional arc flow x_{ij} > capacity − ε):

    1. Identify C(i,j) = {routes k : arc (i,j) ∈ route k}.
    2. If C(i,j) is a cover (Σ_{k ∈ C} demand_k > arc_capacity), form the
       basic cover inequality:
           Σ_{k ∈ C} λ_k ≤ |C| − 1
    3. Lift coefficients for routes NOT in C using the Gu et al. (1995a)
       exact sequence-independent procedure:
           α_k = max p s.t. p routes from \bar{C} can fit with remaining capacity.
    4. Translate to the path-based formulation via delta_{ij}^p indicators.
    5. Add violated LCI to the master.

    Pricing Integration (§4.2):
    In the VRPP RCSPP, when the DP traverses arc (i,j), the reduced cost is
    decreased by α_{ij}^k · γ_{ij}, exactly as in the paper.  Since arcs are
    unit-capacity in VRPP, α_{ij}^k = 1 for all routes in C, and the lifting
    coefficients for routes outside C are computed via the Gu heuristic.

    Arc Capacity in VRPP:
    ---------------------
    In Set Partitioning, each arc can appear in at most 1 selected route in any
    integer solution.  A fractional LP may assign more than 1.0 total flow to an
    arc across multiple fractional routes; this constitutes arc saturation.
    The corresponding capacity knapsack is:
        Σ_{k : arc ∈ route_k} λ_k ≤ 1   (arc capacity = 1 in unit-flow VRP)

    r"""Fractional/Rounded Multistar Inequality separation engine for VRPP.

    Targets the Generalized Multistar Inequalities (Letchford, Eglese, Lysgaard 2002),
    adapted for the VRPP Set Partitioning formulation.

    Mathematical Formulation:
    -------------------------
    For S ⊆ V \ {0}:
        ∑_{e ∈ δ(S)} x_e ≥ (2/Q) ∑_{i ∈ S} d_i y_i
                           + (2/Q) ∑_{j ∉ S∪{0}} d_j · (∑_{i ∈ S} x_{ij})

    Re-written in route variables as ∑_k a_k λ_k ≥ 0, where per route k:
        a_k = crossings(k,S) − (2/Q)·visit_demand(k,S) − (2/Q)·adj_demand(k,S)

    Stored in Gurobi as ∑_k (−a_k) λ_k ≤ 0 with dual γ_S ≥ 0.

    Pricing Dual Integration:
    -------------------------
    When extending label from node u to v, the per-arc contribution to a_k is:

    Case (u∈S, v∉S) — crossing out:
        arc_a_k = 1 − (2/Q)·d_v     (d_v = adj demand; 0 if v is depot)
    Case (v∈S, u∉S) — crossing in:
        arc_a_k = 1 − (2/Q)·d_u − (2/Q)·d_v
        (d_u = adj demand of u if u ≠ depot; d_v = visit demand of v)
    Case (u∈S, v∈S) — interior:
        arc_a_k = −(2/Q)·d_v
    Case (u∉S, v∉S) — exterior:
        arc_a_k = 0

    Reduced cost delta = +arc_a_k · γ_S  (positive because coefficient in LP
    is −a_k; dual γ_S ≥ 0 for ≤ constraint in maximisation).

    This is implemented in RCSPPSolver._extend_label via the
    ``multistar_items`` argument — see solver.py.
