class BPCParams:
    """
    Configuration parameters for the Branch-and-Price-and-Cut solver.

    Attributes:
        optimality_gap: Relative gap for proven optimality.
        early_termination_gap: Gap at which we stop the search (heuristic shortcut).
        use_ng_routes: Whether to use ng-route relaxation in pricing.
        ng_neighborhood_size: Size of ng-neighborhoods for relaxation.
        enable_heuristic_rcc_separation: Whether to enable (heuristic) fractional RCC separation.
        enable_comb_cuts: Whether to enable heuristic comb inequalities.
        cut_orthogonality_threshold: cosine similarity ceiling for cut filtering.
        enable_column_pool_deduplication: Whether to enable column pool deduplication.
        rc_tolerance: Minimum reduced cost to accept a new column.
        exact_mode: Whether to enable strict exact management (no dual smoothing).
        strong_branching_size: Number of candidates to evaluate in strong branching.
        cg_at_root_only: Run column generation only at the root B&B node; at all
            descendant nodes, no new columns are generated (use the pool built at
            root).  Replicates the "CG at root only" experiment in Table 2 of
            Barnhart, Hane, and Vance (2000).  Trades solution quality for speed.


    Note:
        enable_heuristic_rcc_separation replaces the legacy enable_fractional_capacity_cuts
        to clarify that the connected-component-based separation is a heuristic,
        not an exact max-flow separation on the full support graph.
