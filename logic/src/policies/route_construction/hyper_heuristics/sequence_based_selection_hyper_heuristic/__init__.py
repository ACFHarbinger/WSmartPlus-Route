Sequence-based Selection Hyper-Heuristic (SS-HH) for VRPP.

This module implements the Sequence-based Selection Hyper-Heuristic (SS-HH)
solver for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Profit (VRPP). The SS-HH is an
online-learning hyper-heuristic that models the search as a sequence of moves.
It learns the transition probabilities between low-level heuristics based on their
historical performance in discovering improving or intensifying solutions.
