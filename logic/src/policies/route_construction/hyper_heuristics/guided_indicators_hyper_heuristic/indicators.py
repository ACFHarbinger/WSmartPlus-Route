Guidance Indicators for GIHH.

This module implements the two guidance indicators used by the hyper-heuristic
to evaluate Low-Level Heuristics (LLHs) based on their Pareto performance:

1. ScoreA (Quality Reward): Increased when an offspring is accepted into the Pareto Archive.
2. ScoreB (Directional Reward): Tracks objective bias (e.g., +1 for Revenue improvement, -1 for Cost improvement).

        If a heuristic improves BOTH Revenue and Cost simultaneously (a strictly
        dominating move), it is rewarded positively (+1.0) because it represents
        ideal convergence toward the Pareto front. Standard +1/-1 logic applies
