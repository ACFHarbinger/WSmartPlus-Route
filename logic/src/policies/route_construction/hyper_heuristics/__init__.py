"""
Package documentation for Hyper-Heuristics module.

This package implements various Hyper-Heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP).

Attributes:
    - Adaptive Memory Programming (AMPHH): policy_amphh
    - Ant Colony Optimization (ACO): policy_aco_hh
    - Genetic Programming (GP): policy_gp_hh
    - Genetic Programming Multi-Period (GP MP): policy_gp_mp_hh
    - Guided Indicators (GIHH): policy_gihh
    - Hidden Markov Model - Great Deluge (HMM-GD): policy_hmm_gd_hh
    - Hyper-Heuristic Using Local Knowledge (HULK): policy_hulk
    - Matheuristic Hyper-Heuristic (MHH): policy_mhh
    - Population-Based (PHH): policy_phh
    - Selection (SHH): policy_shh
    - Sequence-Based Selection (SS-HH): policy_ss_hh

Examples:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.route_construction.hyper_heuristics import policy_amp_hh
    >>> solver = policy_amp_hh.AMPHHPolicy()
    >>> solution = solver.solve(problem, multi_day_ctx)
