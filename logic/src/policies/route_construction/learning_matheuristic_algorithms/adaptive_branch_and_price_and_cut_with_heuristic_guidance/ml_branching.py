class MLBranchingStrategy:
    """
    Imitation-learning surrogate for strong branching, falling back to
    reliability branching when no trained model is available.

    Role in the Pipeline
    --------------------
    Plugs into the BPC Branch-and-Bound tree as the variable-selection oracle.
    At each fractional LP relaxation, the oracle selects the variable to branch
    on.  Two modes are supported:

    **GNN surrogate (when** ``model`` **is set)**
        A graph neural network trained via imitation learning on strong-
        branching decisions encodes the B&B state as a bipartite graph and
        predicts a ranking score for each fractional variable.  Inference is
        O(|variables|) per node, compared to O(|variables| · LP_solves) for
        exact strong branching.

    **Reliability branching (fallback)**
        Selects the variable with the highest pseudo-cost score:

            Score(xᵢ) = min(Ψ↓ᵢ, Ψ↑ᵢ) + c · max(Ψ↓ᵢ, Ψ↑ᵢ)

        Variables not yet evaluated (no pseudo-cost history) receive score
        +∞ to prioritise exploration of unexplored candidates first.

    Pseudo-cost Update
    ------------------
    After each exact evaluation (strong branching or child LP solve):

        Ψ_new = α · Ψ_old + (1 − α) · Δ_observed

    where Δ is the observed objective degradation per unit of fractionality,
    and α is the EMA coefficient (``pseudocost_ema_alpha``).

    GNN Feature Representation
    --------------------------
    ``compute_gnn_features`` constructs a bipartite graph representation of
    the current fractional LP state:

    Node features (one per fractional variable):
        [current_fill, mean_fill_rate, variance_of_scenario_prizes,
         expected_days_to_overflow]

    Edge features (one per fractional arc in the LP):
        [λ_ij, |reduced_cost_ij|]

    This representation is compatible with standard B&B GNN architectures
    (e.g. Gasse et al. 2019, Nair et al. 2020).

    Attributes
