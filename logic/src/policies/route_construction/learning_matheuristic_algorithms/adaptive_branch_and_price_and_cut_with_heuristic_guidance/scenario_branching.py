class ScenarioConsistentBranching:
    """
    Dynamic branching rule that leverages the optimal solutions of individual
    scenario subproblems to select variables with the strongest cross-scenario
    consensus.

    Motivation
    ----------
    In stochastic programming B&B, a natural branching heuristic is to branch
    on the fractional variable that most scenarios "agree on" when each is
    solved deterministically.  A variable with consensus near 1 is almost
    always set to 1 across scenarios; near 0 it is almost never selected.
    Either extreme implies a high-confidence branch.  A consensus near 0.5
    signals genuine ambiguity and is branched on last.

    Branching Score
    ---------------
    For variable g_i:

        consensus(g_i) = |{ξ : g_i^ξ = 1}| / |Ξ|

        score(g_i) = |consensus(g_i) − 0.5|

    The variable maximising this score is selected; it corresponds to the
    variable with the least ambiguity across the scenario tree.

    Horizon Adaptivity
    ------------------
    The commented-out threshold logic in ``select_branching_variable`` sketches
    an adaptive variant where the minimum acceptable consensus is decayed as
    the horizon shortens:

        threshold(d) = base_threshold · (days_remaining / initial_horizon)

    This allows looser consensus requirements near the end of the horizon,
    where the stochastic structure collapses and all scenarios converge.
    The current implementation uses the pure score-maximisation variant,
    which is equivalent to setting threshold = 0.

    Attributes
    ----------
    base_threshold : float
        Reference consensus threshold used as the anchor for horizon-adaptive
        decay.  Currently serves as a documentation reference; the active
        branching rule is threshold-free.

                is considered strongly agreed upon.  Used in the adaptive
                variant; the current implementation is threshold-free.

        Compute the fraction of scenarios in which variable ``var_id`` is set to 1.

        A value of 1.0 means all scenarios include this variable (strong
        positive consensus); 0.0 means none do (strong negative consensus);
        0.5 is returned as the uninformative default when no solutions are
        available.

                assignment) whose consensus is to be measured.
            scenario_tree: ScenarioTree providing the scenario structure.
                Currently unused but available for probability-weighted
                extensions (replace uniform count with Σ_ξ p_ξ · g_i^ξ).
