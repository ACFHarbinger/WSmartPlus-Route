"""
LKH-3 Tour Adapter Module.

Provides :class:`TourAdapter`, a thin shim that lets the flat ``List[int]``
tour representation used by the LKH-3 solver be consumed directly by the
operator interface shared across the local-search framework.

Background
----------
The framework's intra-route operators (:func:`move_kopt_intra`) and
perturbation operators (:func:`double_bridge`) are written against a
``LocalSearch``-style object that exposes:

- ``routes``     — a list of mutable open route lists (no closing duplicate).
- ``d``          — a 2-D distance matrix indexed by node id.
- ``C``          — a cost scale factor (positive = minimise).
- ``_update_map(route_set)`` — called by an operator after it mutates a route.

:class:`TourAdapter` satisfies that contract for a single route, allowing all
existing operators to be reused without modification inside the LKH-3 solver.

Public API
----------
TourAdapter(tour, distance_matrix)
    Wrap a closed or open tour list and a distance matrix.

TourAdapter.routes
    ``[route]`` where *route* is the mutable open node list.

TourAdapter.to_closed_tour() -> List[int]
    Reconstruct the closed tour (first node appended at end) after an
    operator may have mutated ``routes[0]`` in-place.

TourAdapter._updated
    Boolean flag set to ``True`` the first time ``_update_map`` is called,
    allowing callers to detect whether an operator applied a move.

Attributes:
    TourAdapter: Adapter for LKH-3 tours.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.helpers.operators.heuristics._tour_adapter import TourAdapter
    >>> adapter = TourAdapter(tour, distance_matrix)
    >>> applied = move_kopt_intra(adapter, u=u, v=v, r_u=0, p_u=i, r_v=0, p_v=j, k=2)
    >>> if applied:
    >>>     tour = adapter.to_closed_tour()

class TourAdapter:
    """
    Minimal adapter that presents a flat tour list as a single-route
    ``LocalSearch``-compatible object.

    Both ``move_kopt_intra`` and ``double_bridge`` expect an object with:

    - ``routes``: list of mutable route lists (open, no closing duplicate).
    - ``d``: distance matrix (2-D array-like, indexed by node id).
    - ``C``: cost scale factor (1.0 for minimisation).
    - ``_update_map(route_set)``: called after a move mutates the route.

    The adapter wraps a single flat tour (without the closing duplicate) as
    ``routes[0]``, exposes the distance matrix and a unit cost scale, and
    records whether ``_update_map`` was invoked so callers can detect that a
    move was applied.

    Attributes:
        routes: The route list.
        d: The distance matrix.
        C: The cost scale factor.
        _updated: Whether the route was mutated by an operator.
