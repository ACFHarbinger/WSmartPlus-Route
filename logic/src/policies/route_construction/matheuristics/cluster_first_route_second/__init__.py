"""
Cluster-First Route-Second (CF-RS) Routing Policy.

This package implements the CF-RS algorithm, a variant of the Fisher and Jaikumar (1981)
heuristic. It partitions nodes into angular sectors centered at the depot (Clustering)
and solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for each sector (Routing).

The package supports two assignment methods:
- Greedy: Original Fisher & Jaikumar heuristic (Sultana & Akhand, 2017)
- Exact: Mixed-Integer Programming using Gurobi

Modules:
    solver: Core implementation of the angular clustering and TSP routing.
    greedy_assignment: Greedy heuristic for node-to-cluster assignment.
    mip_assignment: Exact MIP formulation for node-to-cluster assignment.
    policy_cf_rs: Simulator adapter for the CF-RS algorithm.

Attributes:
    ClusterFirstRouteSecondPolicy: Policy adapter class for CF-RS.
    run_cf_rs: Core solver function for CF-RS routing.
    assign_greedy: Greedy cluster assignment function.
    assign_exact_mip: Exact MIP cluster assignment function.

Example:
    >>> from logic.src.policies.route_construction.matheuristics.cluster_first_route_second import ClusterFirstRouteSecondPolicy
    >>> policy = ClusterFirstRouteSecondPolicy()
