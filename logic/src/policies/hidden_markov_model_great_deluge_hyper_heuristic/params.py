    """
    Configuration parameters for the Hidden Markov Model + Great Deluge Hyper-Heuristic solver.

    The solver is an online-learning hyper-heuristic.  A Hidden Markov Model
    (HMM) learns which Low-Level Heuristic (LLH) to invoke based on the
    observed sequence of search states (improving / stagnating / escaping).
    The Great Deluge criterion replaces simulated annealing: solutions are
    accepted when their profit exceeds a monotonically falling water level.

    LLH Pool (5 operators, indices 0-4):
      L0: random_removal  + greedy_insertion
      L1: worst_removal   + regret_2_insertion
      L2: cluster_removal + greedy_insertion
      L3: worst_removal   + greedy_insertion
      L4: random_removal  + regret_2_insertion

    HMM States: 0=improving, 1=stagnating, 2=escaping

    Attributes:
        max_iterations: Total LLH applications.
        flood_margin: Initial water level = best_profit * (1 + flood_margin).
        rain_speed: Water level decrease per iteration (absolute profit units).
        learning_rate: Online HMM transition probability update step size.
        n_removal: Nodes removed per destroy step.
        n_llh: Number of LLHs in the pool (fixed at 5).
        local_search_iterations: Number of local search iterations.
        time_limit: Wall-clock time limit in seconds.
